UI is a system used to build user interfaces. It provides a range of tools and components to help developers create interactive interface elements. Here are its key features:

- **Visual Editing**: With the basic nodes and component creation capabilities in the [editor](https://galacean.antgroup.com/editor/projects), combined with the RectTool (shortcut key T), developing interactive interfaces becomes more intuitive and efficient.
- **Rendering and Interactive Components**: Supports rendering components like Image, Text, etc., as well as basic interactive components such as Button.
- **Transferable Opacity and Interactivity Attributes**: Through the UIGroup component, properties such as **opacity** and **interactivity** can be inherited or ignored.
- **Events**: In addition to supporting original Pointer events, UI components also support **event bubbling** for interactions triggered by the UI.
