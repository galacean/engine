The `Image` component is used to display images within a `UICanvas`.

## Editor Usage

### Add Image Node

Add an `Image` node in the **[Hierarchy Panel](/docs/interface/hierarchy/)**.

<Image src="https://mdn.alipayobjects.com/huamei_yo47yq/afts/img/A*9SCNTZNglo0AAAAAAAAAAAAAehuCAQ/original" style={{zoom:"50%"}} />

> If the parent or ancestor node does not have a Canvas component, a root canvas node will be automatically added.

### Set Sprite

The content displayed by the `Image` depends on the selected [Sprite asset](). Select the node with the `Image` component, and in the **[Inspector Panel](/docs/interface/inspector)**, choose the corresponding sprite asset in the Sprite property to change the displayed content.

### Modify Draw Mode

The `Image` component currently provides three draw modes: Normal, Nine-Patch, and Tiled (the default is Normal). You can visually feel the rendering differences between modes by modifying the width and height in each mode.
