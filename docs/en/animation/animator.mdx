## Introduction
The `Animator` Component ([API](/apis/core/#Animator)) is responsible for reading the data from the `AnimatorController` ([detailed introduction](/docs/animation/animatorController/)) and playing its content.

### Parameter Description

| Property               | Description                       |
| :----------------- | :----------------------------- |
| animatorController | Bind the `AnimatorController` asset |

## Editor Usage

When you drag a model into the scene, the model is displayed in its initial pose and does not play any animation. At this time, you need to find the `Animator` Component on the model entity and bind an `AnimatorController` asset to it.

1. Find or create an `Animator` Component

<Callout type="info">
The `Animator` Component of the model is on the root entity of the glTF instance, which is the first child `entity` under the model entity in the editor.

If the model has animations, a read-only `AnimatorController` will be automatically bound for you.
</Callout>

If there is no `Animator` Component, you can create it as shown below

2. Create an `AnimatorController` asset and bind it to the model. There are two ways to create an `AnimatorController`:
    1. Right-click on the blank space in the **[Asset Panel](/docs/assets/interface)** and select `Create` -> `Animation Controller`

    2. Click the add asset button `+` and select `Animation Controller`

3. Replace the `AnimatorController` property of the `Animator` Component with the `AnimatorController` just created

4. After editing the `AnimatorController` (you can refer to the [AnimatorController](/docs/animation/animatorController) document), you can play the animations in it

## Script Usage

Before using scripts, it is recommended to read the following documents:

- [Script](/docs/script/script)
- [Animation System Composition](/docs/animation/system)

### Play Specified Animation State

You can use the [animator.play](/apis/core/#Animator-play) method to play the specified `AnimatorState` . For parameter descriptions, see the [API documentation](/apis/core/#Animator-play).

```typescript
import { Script, Animator, Keys } from '@galacean/engine';

export default class extends Script {
  onStart() {
    const animator = this.entity.getComponent(Animator);
    animator.play("State Name");
  }
}
```

If you need to start playing at a certain point in the animation, you can do so as follows

```typescript
import { Script, Animator, Keys } from '@galacean/engine';

export default class extends Script {
  onStart() {
    const animator = this.entity.getComponent(Animator);
    const layerIndex = 0;
    const normalizedTimeOffset = 0.5; // Normalized time
    animator.play("State Name", layerIndex, normalizedTimeOffset);
  }
}
```

### Control Playback Speed

You can control the playback speed of the animation through the [speed](/apis/core/#Animator-speed) property. The default value of `speed` is `1.0`, the larger the value, the faster the playback, the smaller the value, the slower the playback. When the value is negative, it plays in reverse.

```typescript
animator.speed = 2.0;
```

### Stop/Resume Playback

You can stop and resume the animation by setting [animator.enabled](/apis/core/#Animator-enabled).

```typescript
// Stop
animator.enabled = false;
// Resume
animator.enabled = true;
```

### Pause/Resume Playback
You can pause and resume playback by setting [animator.speed](/apis/core/#Animator-speed).

```typescript
// Pause
animator.speed = 0;
// Resume
animator.speed = 1;
```

If you only want to pause a specific `AnimatorState` , you can do so by setting its speed to 0.

```typescript
const state = animator.findAnimatorState("xxx");
state.speed = 0;
```

### Transition to Specified Animation State

You can use the [animator.crossfade](/apis/core/#Animator-crossfade) method to transition to the specified `AnimatorState` . For parameter descriptions, see the [API documentation](/apis/core/#Animator-crossFade).

```typescript
animator.crossFade("OtherStateName", 0.3);
```

### Get Current Playing Animation State

You can use the [getCurrentAnimatorState](/apis/core/#Animator-getCurrentAnimatorState) method to get the currently playing `AnimatorState` . The parameter is the index `layerIndex` of the `AnimatorControllerLayer` where the `AnimatorState` is located. For details, see the [API documentation](/apis/core/#Animator-getCurrentAnimatorState). After obtaining it, you can set the properties of the `AnimatorState` , such as changing the default loop playback to play once.

```typescript
const currentState = animator.getCurrentAnimatorState(0);
// Play once
currentState.wrapMode = WrapMode.Once;
// Loop playback
currentState.wrapMode = WrapMode.Loop;
```

### Get Animation State

You can use the [findAnimatorState](/apis/core/#Animator-findAnimatorState) method to get the specified `AnimatorState` . After obtaining it, you can set the properties of the  `AnimatorState` , such as changing the default loop playback to play once.

```typescript
const state = animator.findAnimatorState("xxx");
// Play once
state.wrapMode = WrapMode.Once;
// Loop playback
state.wrapMode = WrapMode.Loop;
```

### Animation Culling
You can set whether the animation is calculated when the `entity` is not visible by setting the [cullingMode](/apis/core/#Animator-cullingMode) of the `Animator` Component. When the animation is culled, the animation will not be calculated and applied to the `entity`, but the state of the animation will still be updated over time, so that it is correctly displayed when it becomes visible again.
