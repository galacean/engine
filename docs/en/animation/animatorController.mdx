The Animation Controller ([AnimatorController](/en/apis/core/#AnimatorController)) helps you organize a set of animations for characters or other animated objects. It visualizes the animation playback logic of animated objects like a flowchart through the [Animation State Machine](/en/docs/animation/state-machine/) ([AnimatorStateMachine](/en/apis/core/#AnimatorStateMachine)) and automatically switches animation states ([AnimatorState](/en/apis/core/#AnimatorState)) and plays the referenced [Animation Clips](/en/docs/animation/clip) ([AnimationClip](/en/apis/core/#AnimationClip)) when conditions are met.

## Editor Usage

Through the Animation Controller editor, users can organize the playback logic of [Animation Clips](/en/docs/animation/clip).

1. Prepare the Animation Clips ([Create Animation Clips](/en/docs/animation/clip)).

2. To organize the playback of these Animation Clips, we need to create an Animation Controller ([AnimatorController](/en/apis/core/#AnimatorController)) asset.

3. The newly created Animation Controller has no data. We need to edit it, double-click the asset, and add an Animation State ([AnimatorState](/en/apis/core/#AnimatorState)) to it.

4. Click AnimatorState to bind an [Animation Clip](/en/docs/animation/clip) ([AnimationClip](/en/apis/core/#AnimationClip)) to it.

5. Bind the Animation Controller ([AnimatorController](/en/apis/core/#AnimatorController)) asset to the [Animation Control Component](/en/docs/animation/animator).

6. At this point, you can play the `Idle` animation in the exported project through `animator.play("New State")`.

## Script Usage

<Callout type="positive">
  Before using scripts, it is best to read the [Animation System Composition](/en/docs/animation/system) documentation to help you better understand the operation logic of the animation system.

### Binding the Animation Controller

You can bind the Animation Controller to the [Animator](/en/apis/core/#Animator) through the [animator.animatorController](/en/apis/core/#Animator-animatorController) property. If the loaded glTF model has animation data, it will automatically bind a default AnimatorController to each glTF instance.

```typescript
animator.animatorController = new AnimatorController(engine);
animator.play("New State");
```

#### Reusing Animation Data

The [animatorController](/en/apis/core/#AnimatorController) of the Animator is a data storage class and does not contain runtime data. Based on this design, as long as the hierarchical structure and naming of the skeletal nodes of the model bound to the Animator component are the same, we can reuse the animation data of this model.

```typescript
const animator = model1.getComponent(Animator);
// 获取动画模型的动画控制器
animator.animatorController = animationGLTF.getComponent(Animator).animatorController;
// 播放 animationGLTF 的动画
animator.play("anim from animationGLTF");
```
