**Animation Clip** is one of the core elements of the Galacean animation system. Galacean supports importing model animations designed with external design software. Each animation in the model with animations output by the designer will be parsed into individual **animation clip** assets in Galacean. We can also create additional animations through the animation clip editor.

There are two common ways to obtain animation clips:

1. Import models with animations created using third-party tools (such as Autodesk® 3ds Max®, Autodesk® Maya®, Blender). See [Creating Animation Clips for Artists](/en/docs/animation/clip-for-artist)

![1](https://mdn.alipayobjects.com/huamei_3zduhr/afts/img/A*Qc8sQ6iJd8IAAAAAAAAAAAAADsJ_AQ/original)

2. Create animation clips in Galacean (the editor and script creation methods will be introduced below).

## Animation Panel Introduction

The animation clip editor currently supports editing all interpolable properties except for physics-related components. If you need to edit other properties, you need to add the corresponding components to the entity.

> Note: The Galacean animation editor defaults to 60FPS. The time `0:30` shown in the figure above is at the 30th frame. If the timeline scale is `1:30`, it is at the 90th frame.

## Basic Operations

### Transform Component Example

1. In the **[Assets Panel](/en/docs/assets/interface)**, right-click/click + to create an `Animation Clip` asset.

![alt text](https://mdn.alipayobjects.com/huamei_3zduhr/afts/img/A*j4FMRKx91nEAAAAAAAAAAAAADsJ_AQ/original)

2. Double-click the `Animation Clip` asset and select an entity as the editing object for the `Animation Clip`.

![alt text](https://mdn.alipayobjects.com/huamei_3zduhr/afts/img/A*_E1kRqt8LroAAAAAAAAAAAAADsJ_AQ/original)

Clicking the `Create` button will automatically add the [Animation Control Component](/en/docs/animation/animator) to your entity and add the animation clip to the [Animation Controller](/en/docs/animation/animatorController/).

3. Add the properties to animate (here I added two).

4. Add keyframes to the properties.

![alt text](https://mdn.alipayobjects.com/huamei_3zduhr/afts/img/A*QnQwR6tLRYMAAAAAAAAAAAAADsJ_AQ/original)
When we click the add keyframe button, the keyframe will store the current value of the specified property. So when we haven't changed anything, the keyframe stores the `position` value of the entity at that moment. We want it to move to the position (3, 0, 0) after 60 frames, so first modify the cube to (3, 0, 0) through the property panel and then add a keyframe.
![alt text](https://mdn.alipayobjects.com/huamei_3zduhr/afts/img/A*ClTgSriu4-8AAAAAAAAAAAAADsJ_AQ/original)
Similarly, we also add keyframes for the `rotation` property.

##### Recording Mode

We provide a recording mode to facilitate developers in quickly adding keyframes. When recording mode is enabled, keyframes are automatically added when the corresponding properties are modified.

### Text Animation Example

First, you need an entity with a TextRender component.

![alt text](https://mdn.alipayobjects.com/huamei_3zduhr/afts/img/A*VGEGS6kOBqkAAAAAAAAAAAAADsJ_AQ/original)

When we add properties at this point, we can see that the properties that can add keyframes have increased with the interpolable properties related to the `TextRenderer` component.

![alt text](https://mdn.alipayobjects.com/huamei_3zduhr/afts/img/A*X5YxQb_HieUAAAAAAAAAAAAADsJ_AQ/original)

We add keyframes using recording mode as described above.

![alt text](https://mdn.alipayobjects.com/huamei_3zduhr/afts/img/A*tsTqSqZVsdUAAAAAAAAAAAAADsJ_AQ/original)

### Frame Animation Example

In addition to numerical types, Galacean also supports animation curves of reference types. You can read [Frame Animation](/en/docs/animation/sprite-sheet/) to learn how to create frame animations.

### Material Animation Example

Galacean also supports animation editing of asset properties within components. If there are material assets in the component, there will be additional asset property editing in the `Inspector`.

![alt text](https://mdn.alipayobjects.com/huamei_3zduhr/afts/img/A*ctbcSKqHmIAAAAAAAAAAAAAADsJ_AQ/original)

It should be noted that the default [material](/en/docs/graphics/material/material/) in the editor is not editable.

![alt text](https://mdn.alipayobjects.com/huamei_3zduhr/afts/img/A*SNRHQbOcqhAAAAAAAAAAAAAADsJ_AQ/original)

So, if we want to animate the material of this cube, we need to create a new material and replace it. Then, just like above, enable recording mode and directly modify the properties.

## More Operations

### Operating Keyframes

#### Modify Keyframe Time

Select the keyframe and drag it.

![alt text](https://mdn.alipayobjects.com/huamei_3zduhr/afts/img/A*_vZSR4YEDqMAAAAAAAAAAAAADsJ_AQ/original)

You can zoom the timeline by scrolling the `mouse wheel`.

![alt text](https://mdn.alipayobjects.com/huamei_3zduhr/afts/img/A*BTgPS45hkNYAAAAAAAAAAAAADsJ_AQ/original)

#### Modify Keyframe Value

Enable recording mode, move the timeline to the specified keyframe, and then re-enter the value. If recording mode is not enabled, you need to click the add keyframe button again.

![alt text](https://mdn.alipayobjects.com/huamei_3zduhr/afts/img/A*MiSXQZ4q7DMAAAAAAAAAAAAADsJ_AQ/original)

#### Delete Keyframe

Select the keyframe, right-click and choose delete, or press the delete/backspace key on the keyboard.

### Editing Child Entities

`Animation clips` can not only be applied to entities with the `Animator` component but also to their child entities.

1. We add a child entity to the cube we just created.

![alt text](https://mdn.alipayobjects.com/huamei_3zduhr/afts/img/A*6RYIQpG7DPwAAAAAAAAAAAAADsJ_AQ/original)

2. We can see that the properties of the child entity can be added by clicking "Add Property" again.

![alt text](https://mdn.alipayobjects.com/huamei_3zduhr/afts/img/A*j7rfRq0REKIAAAAAAAAAAAAADsJ_AQ/original)

3. Enable recording mode, edit the child entity and add keyframes.

![alt text](https://mdn.alipayobjects.com/huamei_3zduhr/afts/img/A*j7rfRq0REKIAAAAAAAAAAAAADsJ_AQ/original)


### Edit Animation Curves

The `Animation Clip Editor` supports animation curve editing. Click the curve icon in the upper right corner to switch.

![alt text](https://mdn.alipayobjects.com/huamei_3zduhr/afts/img/A*luV0QaDUAQAAAAAAAAAAAAAADsJ_AQ/original)

The vertical axis in curve mode represents the value of the property.

![alt text](https://mdn.alipayobjects.com/huamei_3zduhr/afts/img/A*luV0QaDUAQAAAAAAAAAAAAAADsJ_AQ/original)


You can adjust the vertical axis scale by pressing `shift + mouse wheel`.

![alt text](https://mdn.alipayobjects.com/huamei_3zduhr/afts/img/A*SjO2TaubiuIAAAAAAAAAAAAADsJ_AQ/original)

The color of the curve corresponding to the property is the same as the color of the button.

![alt text](https://mdn.alipayobjects.com/huamei_3zduhr/afts/img/A*OS3uSbdB36AAAAAAAAAAAAAADsJ_AQ/original)

Selecting a keyframe will show two control points. Adjusting the control points will adjust the curve.

![alt text](https://mdn.alipayobjects.com/huamei_3zduhr/afts/img/A*kikYQoiYMLoAAAAAAAAAAAAADsJ_AQ/original)

You can also set built-in preset values directly by right-clicking the keyframe.

![alt text](https://mdn.alipayobjects.com/huamei_3zduhr/afts/img/A*KRzoT5Pocc4AAAAAAAAAAAAADsJ_AQ/original)

Selecting a property in the property panel allows you to edit the curve of the specified property only.



## Using Scripts
<Callout type="positive">
Before using scripts, it is best to read the [Animation System Composition](/en/docs/animation/system) document to help you better understand the operating logic of the animation system.
</Callout>

You can create an [AnimationClip](/apis/core/#AnimationClip) yourself and bind an [AnimationCurve](/apis/core/#AnimationCurve) to it through [addCurveBinding](/apis/core/#AnimationClip-addCurveBinding).

```typescript
//custom rotate clip
const rotateClip = new AnimationClip("rotate");
const rotateState =
  animator.animatorController.layers[0].stateMachine.addState("rotate");
rotateState.clip = rotateClip;

const rotateCurve = new AnimationVector3Curve();
const key1 = new Keyframe<Vector3>();
key1.time = 0;
key1.value = new Vector3(0, 0, 0);
const key2 = new Keyframe<Vector3>();
key2.time = 10;
key2.value = new Vector3(0, 360, 0);
rotateCurve.addKey(key1);
rotateCurve.addKey(key2);
rotateClip.addCurveBinding("", Transform, "rotation", rotateCurve);

//custom color clip
const colorClip = new AnimationClip("color");
const colorState =
  animator.animatorController.layers[0].stateMachine.addState("color");
colorState.clip = colorClip;

const colorCurve = new AnimationFloatCurve();
const key1 = new Keyframe<number>();
key1.time = 0;
key1.value = 0;
const key2 = new Keyframe<number>();
key2.time = 10;
key2.value = 1;
colorCurve.addKey(key1);
colorCurve.addKey(key2);
colorClip.addCurveBinding("/light", DirectLight, "color.r", colorCurve);
```

You can also bind an AnimationCurve to your child entity `/light`, as shown in the code example above. The third parameter of `addCurveBinding` is not limited to the properties of the component; it is a path that can index the value.

### Animation Events

You can use [AnimationEvent](/apis/core/#AnimationEvent) to add events to the AnimationClip. The animation event will call the specified callback function of the component bound to the same entity at the specified time.

```typescript
const event = new AnimationEvent();
event.functionName = "test";
event.time = 0.5;
clip.addEvent(event);
```

<Playground href="/embed/animation-event" />
