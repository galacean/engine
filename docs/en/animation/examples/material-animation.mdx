This example demonstrates how to create material animations in the Galacean editor. Through simple steps, you will learn how to create an AnimationClip for material. If this is your first time using the animation editor, it is recommended to read the previous documents:

[1. Play Animation in Model](/docs/animation/examples/playAnimation/)

[2. Reuse Animation](/docs/animation/examples/reuseAnimation/)

## 0. Preparation
Before starting, we need to add a `MeshRenderer` component to the `entity`. The default project created already has a cube, which contains the `MeshRenderer` component.

In addition, because the default `material` is read-only, we also need to create a `material`.

There are two ways to create a `material`:
1. Right-click on the blank space in the **[Asset Panel](/docs/assets/interface)** and select `Create` -> `Material`

2. Click the add asset button `+` and select `Material`

Replace the `material` property of the `MeshRenderer` with the `material` we just created.

## 1. Create AnimationClip
After adding the component, we need to create an `AnimationClip` (for an introduction to AnimationClip, please refer to the [AnimationClip](/docs/animation/clip) document). There are two ways to create an `AnimationClip`:
1. Right-click on the blank space in the **[Asset Panel](/docs/assets/interface)** and select `Create` -> `AnimationClip`

<Image src="https://mdn.alipayobjects.com/huamei_3zduhr/afts/img/A*XK28Qr2GX6UAAAAAAAAAAAAADsJ_AQ/original" />

2. Click the add asset button `+` and select `AnimationClip`

## 2. Open AnimationClip Editor

1. Double-click the newly created `AnimationClip` asset

<Image src="https://mdn.alipayobjects.com/huamei_3zduhr/afts/img/A*w4ReS7ijXgcAAAAAAAAAAAAADsJ_AQ/original" />

2. Select an `entity`. According to the prompt, we need to select an `entity` in the **[Hierarchy Panel](/docs/interface/hierarchy)** as the target for editing the animation.

Select the default `entity` created by the editor (you can also click the `+` button in the hierarchy panel to create a new one)

<Image src="https://mdn.alipayobjects.com/huamei_3zduhr/afts/img/A*UvZXSryjAngAAAAAAAAAAAAADsJ_AQ/original" />

3. Click the `Create` button in the AnimationClip editor. The editor will prepare some work for you. In this example, you can ignore the understanding of these concepts for now.

<Callout type="info">
The preparation work includes:
1. Creating an `Animator` component ([detailed introduction](/docs/animation/animator/)) for the selected `entity` and creating an `AnimatorController` ([detailed introduction](/docs/animation/animatorController/)) asset.
2. The `AnimatorController` will contain an `Animation State`, and the `Animation State` will automatically bind the selected `AnimationClip` and connect to the `entry` node (for a detailed introduction to the `entry` node, please refer to the [AnimatorStateMachine](/docs/animation/state-machine/) document).
3. The `Animator` component will automatically bind the `AnimatorController`.
</Callout>

After creation, you will open the AnimationClip editor as shown below:

## 3. Edit AnimationClip

1. Enable recording mode in the `AnimationClip` editor

<Image src="https://mdn.alipayobjects.com/huamei_3zduhr/afts/img/A*S4jNRZ-Ia7AAAAAAAAAAAAAADsJ_AQ/original" />

2. Move the timeline to `0:00`, then set the color property of the `material` in the `MeshRenderer` component to red. In recording mode, the editor will automatically add the corresponding property and keyframe.

<Image src="https://mdn.alipayobjects.com/huamei_3zduhr/afts/img/A*N6WqR4SRxCgAAAAAAAAAAAAADsJ_AQ/original" />

3. Set the color property of the `material` in the `MeshRenderer` component to green and blue at `0:20` and `0:40`, respectively. At `1:00`, set it back to red. The first and last keyframes are the same, so the animation can loop naturally. Click the play button to preview this `AnimationClip`.

Now our material color change `AnimationClip` is complete. For more operations about the animation editor, please refer to the [AnimationClip](/docs/animation/clip) document.

For information on how to use this `AnimationClip` in your project, please refer to the two documents listed at the top of the article.
