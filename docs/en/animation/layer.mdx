`AnimatorControllerLayer` ([API](/apis/core/#AnimatorControllerLayer)) is used to organize and manage `AnimatorStateMachine` ([see details](/docs/animation/state-machine/)) in an `Animation Controller` ([detailed introduction](/docs/animation/animatorController)). Each `AnimatorControllerLayer` has its own `Animation State Machine`. When the `Animation Control Component` runs, all `AnimatorControllerLayer` run simultaneously, controlling the overall animation effect through `blending weight` and `blending mode`.

| Property     | Description                                                                           |
| :------- | :--------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Name     | The name of the layer.                                                                       |
| Weight   | The blending weight of the layer, the default value is 1.0.                                                    |
| Blending | The blending mode of the layer, `Additive` is additive mode, `Override` is override mode, the default value is `Override`. |
| StateMachine | The animation state machine of the layer, [detailed introduction](/docs/animation/state-machine/) |

### Additive Mode
In additive mode, the higher layer's animation will be added on top of the lower layer's animation. This mode calculates the differences in animation keyframes and applies these differences to the lower layer's animation, achieving an additive effect (increasing the weight will not reduce the influence of the lower layer). It is often used to add details or adjustments to basic actions. For example, a breathing animation can be added on top of a walking animation using the `Additive` mode, or a facial expression change can be added during an attack.

#### Usage Example
We add an `AnimatorControllerLayer` in the editor and set `Blending` to `Additive`.

### Override Mode
In override mode, the higher layer's animation will completely override the lower layer's animation. This means that in the final animation output, the higher layer's animation will take precedence and replace the lower layer's animation effect (increasing the weight will reduce the influence of the lower layer). It is often used for layered control of animations. For example, you may need to control different body parts' actions separately. The `Override` mode can control each part independently, such as adjusting the upper body's posture or actions while running.
<Callout type="info">
The blending mode of the first layer is always override mode.
</Callout>

#### Usage Example
Set `Blending` to `Override`.

<Image src="https://mdn.alipayobjects.com/huamei_3zduhr/afts/img/A*5TfbQJjPZDMAAAAAAAAAAAAADsJ_AQ/original" />

You can see that the character's animation completely replaces the animation of the first layer.

### Blending Weight
It is used to control the influence of a specific `AnimatorControllerLayer` on the final animation result. It is a floating-point value between 0 and 1, determining the blending ratio of the layer's animation in the final animation. For example, an additive layer will rotate the character's head by 90 degrees. If the layer's blending weight is 0.5, the character will only rotate 45 degrees.
<Callout type="info">
The weight of the first layer is always 1.0.
</Callout>

#### Usage Example
<Image src="https://mdn.alipayobjects.com/huamei_3zduhr/afts/img/A*HSxgTZIDqQ0AAAAAAAAAAAAADsJ_AQ/original" />

You can see that the higher the weight of the `AnimatorControllerLayer`, the greater its influence on the animation effect.

## Script Usage

```typescript
const layers = animator.animatorController.layers;
const baseLayer = layers[0];
const additiveLayer = layers[1];
// Additive mode
additiveLayer.blendingMode = AnimatorLayerBlendingMode.Additive;
// Override mode
additiveLayer.blendingMode = AnimatorLayerBlendingMode.Override;
additiveLayer.weight = 0.5;
```
