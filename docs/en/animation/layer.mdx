## Introduction
Animation layers ([AnimatorControllerLayer](/en/apis/core/#AnimatorControllerLayer)) are used to organize and manage animation state machines within an animation controller ([AnimatorController](/en/apis/core/#AnimatorController)). By using animation layers, developers can combine different animation state machines, making complex animation logic easier to manage and control. Each layer has its own animation state machine, weight, and blending mode.

| Property | Description                                                                        |
| :------- | :--------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Name     | The name of the layer.                                                             |
| Weight   | The blending weight of the layer, default value is 1.0.                            |
| Blending | The blending mode of the layer, `Additive` for additive mode, `Override` for override mode, default is `Override`. |

### Additive Mode
In additive mode, the animation of the higher layer will be added on top of the animation of the lower layer. This mode calculates the differences in animation keyframes and applies these differences to the lower layer animation, achieving an additive effect. It is often used to add details or adjustments to basic actions. For example, a character can use the `Additive` mode to add a breathing animation while walking or add a facial expression change while attacking.

### Override Mode
In override mode, the animation of the higher layer will completely override the animation of the lower layer. This means that in the final animation output, the higher layer animation will take precedence and replace the lower layer animation effect. It is often used for layered control of animations. For example, you might need to control the actions of different body parts separately. The `Override` mode can control each part separately, such as adjusting the posture or actions of the upper body while running.
<Callout type="info">
The blending mode of the first layer is always override mode.
</Callout>

### Blending Weight
It is used to control the influence of a specific animation layer on the final animation result. It is a floating-point value between 0 and 1, determining the blending ratio of the layer's animation in the final animation. For example, if a layer in additive mode makes the character's head turn 90 degrees, and the blending weight of that layer is 0.5, the character will only turn 45 degrees.
<Callout type="info">
The weight of the first layer is always 1.0.

## Editor Usage
### Additive Mode
We add an animation layer in the editor and set `Blending` to `Additive`.

You can see that this character has added a `head shaking` animation on top of the original animation.

### Override Mode
Set `Blending` to `Override`.
![alt text](https://mdn.alipayobjects.com/huamei_3zduhr/afts/img/A*5TfbQJjPZDMAAAAAAAAAAAAADsJ_AQ/original)
You can see that the character's animation completely replaces the animation of the first layer.

### Blending Weight
![alt text](https://mdn.alipayobjects.com/huamei_3zduhr/afts/img/A*HSxgTZIDqQ0AAAAAAAAAAAAADsJ_AQ/original)
You can see that the higher the weight of the animation layer, the greater the impact on the animation effect.


## Script Usage

```typescript
const layers = animator.animatorController.layers;
const baseLayer = layers[0];
const additiveLayer = layers[1];
// 叠加模式
additiveLayer.blendingMode = AnimatorLayerBlendingMode.Additive;
// 覆盖模式
additiveLayer.blendingMode = AnimatorLayerBlendingMode.Override;
additiveLayer.weight = 0.5;
```
