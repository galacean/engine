The Galacean animation system has the following features:

- Parse animations from GLTF/FBX models and convert them into AnimationClip objects in Galacean
- Add animations to all components and their properties in Galacean
- Set the start/end time of animations to trim animations
- Set transitions between animations and overlay multiple animations
- Apply the animation of one model to another model
- Add animation events and animation lifecycle scripts

## Animation Workflow

The overall workflow for creating interactive projects using the editor:

 Add AnimationClip --> Create AnimatorController and Import AnimationClip --> Add Animator Component to Play Animation
```

### 1. Add AnimationClip

The Galacean animation system is based on the concept of animation clips, which contain information about how certain objects should change their position, rotation, or other properties over time. Each AnimationClip can be considered a single linear recording.

You can create AnimationClips in the editor, see [Creating Animation Clips](/docs/animation/clip) for details. You can also import models with animations created using third-party tools (such as Autodesk速 3ds Max速, Autodesk速 Maya速, Blender), see [Creating Animation Clips for Artists](/docs/animation/clip-for-artist) for details, or from motion capture studios or other sources.

### 2. Create AnimatorController and Import AnimationClip

The AnimatorController is a structured system similar to a flowchart. It acts as a state machine in the animation system, responsible for tracking which clip should be played currently and when animations should change or blend together.

You can learn how to use it in this [AnimatorController](/docs/animation/animatorController/) article.

### 3. Add Animator Component

After editing the AnimatorController, we need to add the [Animator](/docs/animation/animator) to the entity and bind the AnimatorController asset to play the animation.
