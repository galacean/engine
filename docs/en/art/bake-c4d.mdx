Using C4D-OC renderer baking (Windows) as an example.

### What is Baking

Baking is the process of expressing all the rendered material color information in the form of a texture map.

Baking requires two sets of models: a high-poly model and a low-poly model. The high-poly model is used to bake more detailed textures, while the low-poly model is used in the engine with the textures. Both models must have consistent UVs, so the low-poly model is created first with UVs laid out, then detailed to create the high-poly model. The high-poly model can have more details to bake richer textures.

The left is the low-poly model, and the right is the high-poly model. The wiring information shows that the high-poly model has more details.

Although the wiring details differ, the visible parts of both models must be consistent. The covered parts are not considered, so the high-poly model must be derived from the low-poly model to ensure UV consistency.

### Specific Baking Process

1. Adjust the high-poly model in C4D to render the desired effect. Textures used on the face should also be drawn according to the overall UV layout. Once the materials are adjusted, you can prepare for baking.

2. An important point in baking is to select the camera mode. Specify the tag for the camera to be output, and add the unique camera tag of the OC renderer.

3. Click the added camera tag to enter the tag properties. There are many options for the camera type, one of which is baking. Select baking.

4. In the baking menu, set the baking group ID to a number other than 1, here it is set to 2.

5. Then group the models to be baked. As shown below, group all the required models and add the OC object tag.

6. Click the tag to display the tag properties, select the object layer, and set the baking ID inside to the same value as the baking group ID, which is 2 here. Then click render to bake the required image.

If you are not very satisfied with the baking results, both C4D and Substance Painter can be used to paint and modify the textures. Realistic rendering is not the only option; painting textures can also be used to restore some special styles.
