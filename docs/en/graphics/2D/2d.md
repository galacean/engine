Galacean is a 3D/2D interactive solution. You can quickly experience 2D interactive development by **clicking Template** -> **Flappy Bird** in the **Menu View** on the **Editor Homepage**.

You can also create a blank 2D project by **clicking New Project** -> **2D Project** in the **Project View** on the **Editor Homepage**.

In the editor, there is not much difference between 2D and 3D projects, except that the perspective switches from 3D to 2D, and the default camera is set to **orthographic**. In the **Hierarchy Interface**, you can **select a node and right-click** -> **2D Object** to quickly create a 2D child node.
In a 2D project, you can attach a **Sprite Renderer** and set **Sprite Assets** to render images, use a **Text Renderer** to render 2D text, use **SpriteMask** to achieve masking effects for 2D elements, and use Lottie or Spine (2D skeletal animation) to display 2D effects. For performance optimization, you can also pack **sprites** into a **sprite atlas** to improve request and rendering performance.
