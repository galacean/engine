## Features

Newly created 2D projects come pre-configured with the following features:  

| Configuration       | Description                                                                 |
|---------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Scene Settings**  | Displays 2D-specific scenes, disables unnecessary configurations like skybox and post-processing. |
| **Resources**       | Removes built-in resources unused in 2D mode.                               |
| **Camera Controls** | Sets the scene camera to operate in 2D mode.                                |

## 2D Development Toolchain

Galacean provides a comprehensive 2D development toolchain:  

### **Basic Rendering Assets & Components**  
- [Sprite Assets](/docs/graphics/2D/sprite/): Define display results for Sprite Renderers and Sprite Masks.  
- [Sprite Renderer](/docs/graphics/2D/spriteRenderer/): Renders images by binding sprite assets after attaching the component.  
- [Text Renderer](/docs/graphics/2D/text/): Supports bitmap font rendering.  

### **Advanced Effects**  
- [Sprite Mask](/docs/graphics/2D/spriteMask/): Provides masking effects for sprites and text renderers.  
- [Spine](/docs/graphics/2D/spine/overview): Professional 2D skeletal animation system for complex animations.  
- [Lottie](/docs/graphics/2D/lottie/): Ideal for UI animations.  

### **Performance Optimization**  
- [Sprite Atlas](/docs/graphics/2D/spriteAtlas/): Combines scattered sprites into atlases to reduce Draw Calls and resource requests.
