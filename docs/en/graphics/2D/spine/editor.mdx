This section introduces how to import Spine animation assets into the Galacean editor.

## 1. Export Assets from Spine Editor  
The first step is to export your Spine animation assets from the Spine editor. Complete steps can be found in the [Spine User Guide](https://zh.esotericsoftware.com/spine-user-guide):  

1. [Export skeleton and animation data](https://zh.esotericsoftware.com/spine-export)  
2. [Export texture atlases containing skeleton images](https://zh.esotericsoftware.com/spine-texture-packer)  

Below is a brief workflow for exporting Spine assets:  

1. After completing your animation, click **Spine Menu** > **Export** to open the export window.

2. Select **Binary** in the top-left corner of the export window (Recommended: Binary format reduces file size and improves loading speed compared to JSON).

3. Check the **Texture Atlas Packing** checkbox.

4. Click **Pack Settings**.  
   This refers to texture packing settings. For configuration details, refer to the [official documentation](https://zh.esotericsoftware.com/spine-texture-packer). After configuring, click **OK**.

5. Return to the export window, select an export folder, then click **Export**.

6. After exporting, you will get three files:

   - **spineboy.skel**: Contains skeleton structure and animation data, the core information for binding animations to bones.  
   - **spineboy.atlas**: Stores texture atlas information, including position and size details for each texture in the atlas.  
   - **Texture images**: May include multiple pages of images representing the atlas for rendering the characterâ€™s visual content.

## 2. Import Assets into Galacean Editor  

After opening the editor, drag the exported files directly into the [Asset Panel](/en/docs/assets/interface/) to complete the upload, as shown in the following animation:

After uploading, the asset panel will display the uploaded Spine assets, including: **SpineSkeletonData asset**, **SpineAtlas asset**, and texture assets.  

### SpineSkeletonData Asset  
<Image src="https://mdn.alipayobjects.com/huamei_irlgws/afts/img/A*-U5CRKWiRlsAAAAAAAAAAAAADvX8AQ/original" width="110" alt="Spine skeleton data asset icon" />  

The **SpineSkeletonData** asset stores skeleton data and references the generated **SpineAtlas** asset.  
Clicking the asset allows you to preview the Spine animation in the inspector, where you can switch between **skins** and **animation clips**:

### SpineAtlas Asset  
<Image src="https://mdn.alipayobjects.com/huamei_irlgws/afts/img/A*OGNbSaCYQlwAAAAAAAAAAAAADvX8AQ/original" width="108" alt="Spine atlas asset" />  

The **SpineAtlas** asset stores the texture atlas file and references required **Texture** assets.  
Clicking the asset allows you to view its referenced textures and Spine atlas information in the inspector:

### Asset Updates  
To update your Spine assets, re-export them from the Spine editor and re-import into the Galacean editor to overwrite existing files.
