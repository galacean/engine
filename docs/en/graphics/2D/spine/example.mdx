## Templates

The Galacean editor provides a series of tutorial templates to help you quickly get started with using Spine animations.
After entering the [editor](https://galacean.antgroup.com/editor/projects), you can click on the Templates Tab on the left to view these templates.

**Animation Control**

This template demonstrates how to use the `setAnimation` and `addAnimation` APIs of `AnimationState` to orchestrate Spine animations:

**Animation Transition and Blending**

This template shows how to set transitions and blend animations between different tracks in Spine:

**Mix and Match Outfits**

This template demonstrates the capability of Spine to mix and match outfits. By freely combining attachments from different skins, you can mix and match accessories from various skins:

**Dynamic Partial Skin Switching**

This template showcases the ability to dynamically switch partial skins. You can create new attachments based on an additionally uploaded atlas and replace them dynamically.
