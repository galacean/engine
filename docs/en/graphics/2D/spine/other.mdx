### Performance Recommendations  
1. **Use binary files (`.skel`)** for exporting skeletons. Binary files are smaller in size and load faster.  
2. **Minimize the number of atlas pages** by packing attachments into as few texture atlases as possible. Organize attachments in atlas pages according to rendering order to avoid unnecessary material switches. Refer to: [Spine Texture Packer - Folder Structure](https://zh.esotericsoftware.com/spine-texture-packer#%E6%96%87%E4%BB%B6%E5%A4%B9%E7%BB%93%E6%9E%84) for guidance on arranging atlas regions in your Spine atlas.  
3. **Avoid using clipping features**. Spine's clipping is implemented via dynamic triangle trimming, which is computationally expensive.  
4. **Limit the use of atlas page textures**. Aim to keep the number of exported texture images to a minimum (ideally one).  
5. **Share a single atlas texture across multiple skeletons** when possible. For example, add multiple skeletons to the same Spine project and select a single atlas during export. This allows multiple skeletons to reference the same atlas texture.
