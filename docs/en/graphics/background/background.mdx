Developers can customize the background for scenes, which will be rendered before the scene rendering. Currently, Galacean mainly supports the following types of backgrounds:

- [Solid Color Background](/en/docs/graphics-background-solidColor)
- [Texture Background](/en/docs/graphics-background-texture)
- [Sky Background](/en/docs/graphics-background-sky)
