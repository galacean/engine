## Depth Texture

You can enable the depth texture by using the [depthTextureMode](/apis/galacean/#Camera-depthTextureMode) property of the camera. Once enabled, the depth texture can be accessed in the Shader through the `camera_DepthTexture` property.

Common uses of depth textures include:
- Implementing soft particle effects
- Smooth transitions at water edges
- Simple post-processing effects

<Callout type="info">
Note: Depth textures only render non-transparent objects. Transparent objects will not write to the depth texture.

## Opaque Texture

You can enable the opaque texture by using the [opaqueTextureEnabled](/apis/galacean/#Camera-opaqueTextureEnabled) property of the camera. Once enabled, Shaders in the transparent queue can use the `camera_OpaqueTexture` property.

Additionally, you can set the downsampling level through the [opaqueTextureDownsampling](/apis/galacean/#Camera-opaqueTextureDownsampling) property of the camera to balance clarity and performance.
