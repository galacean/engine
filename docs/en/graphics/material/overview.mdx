Material is a core concept in 3D rendering that determines the visual appearance of object surfaces. In the Galacean engine, materials consist of three core components:

## Core Components

### üé® Shader
Shaders are programs that run on the GPU, responsible for calculating the final color of each pixel. Galacean provides a powerful shader language that allows you to:
- Use familiar GLSL syntax
- Enjoy advanced abstraction and management features
- Easily define material properties and rendering configurations

Refer to [Shader Introduction](/en/docs/graphics/material/shader) to learn about Shader syntax.

### üìä Shader Data (ShaderData)
Shader data contains various parameters required for rendering, such as:
- **Material Properties**: color, texture, roughness, etc.
- **Built-in Variables**: time, camera position, lighting information, etc.
- **Macro Switches**: control the enabling and disabling of shader features

Refer to [Built-in Variables Documentation](/en/docs/graphics/material/variables) to learn about available built-in variables.

### ‚öôÔ∏è Render States (RenderStates)
Render states control how the GPU processes geometry, including:
- **Blend State**: controls transparency and color blending
- **Depth State**: controls depth testing and writing
- **Stencil State**: implements complex masking effects
- **Raster State**: controls face culling and polygon mode

Refer to [Render States](/en/docs/graphics/material/shader/#render-state-specification) to learn about all configurable render states.

## Quick Start

If you're not familiar with creating and using materials, you can first go to [Basic Material Usage](/en/docs/graphics/material/baseUse) to learn the basics.

### Using Built-in Shaders
Galacean provides various ready-to-use shaders:

| Shader Type | Use Case | Features |
|-----------|---------|------|
| [PBR](/en/docs/graphics/material/builtinShaders/pbr) | Realistic rendering | Physics-based, follows energy conservation |
| [Unlit](/en/docs/graphics/material/builtinShaders/unlit) | Baked models | Unaffected by lighting, excellent performance |
| [Blinn Phong](/en/docs/graphics/material/builtinShaders/blinnPhong) | Classic lighting | Efficient traditional lighting model |

### Creating Custom Shaders
When built-in shaders cannot meet your needs, you can create custom shaders:

```ts
// Create material
const material = new Material(engine, shader);

// Set material properties
material.shaderData.setColor("material_BaseColor", new Color(1, 0, 0, 1));
material.shaderData.setTexture("material_BaseTexture", texture);
```
