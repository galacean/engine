title: Shader Code Segment Inclusion  
---

To facilitate code reuse, ShaderLab allows including code segments using the `include` macro. These segments are automatically expanded during compilation.

```glsl showLineNumbers
#include "{includeKey}"
```

To make a code segment accessible via the `include` macro, there are two ways to declare it:

## 1. Create Shader / Shader Chunk in the Editor

The `includeKey` for created code segments corresponds to the file path in the project. For example, in the image below, if you want to include the `ShaderChunk` code segment in the `UnlitShader` shader asset, you can reference it using either absolute or relative paths:

```glsl showLineNumbers
// Relative path
#include "./ShaderChunk.glsl"

// Editor-resolved path
#include "/ShaderChunk.glsl"  // Project asset root directory
```

## 2. Register Code Segments in Script

```ts showLineNumbers
import { ShaderFactory } from '@galacean/engine';

const commonSource = `// shader chunk`;
ShaderFactory.registerInclude('includeKey', commonSource);
```

Referencing in ShaderLab:
```glsl showLineNumbers
#include "includeKey"
```

In the current version, the engine provides built-in **PBR** ShaderLab code segments. Developers can use these to customize PBR shaders. Note that you must register these engine-provided ShaderLab code segments before use.

```ts showLineNumbers {4} filename="TypeScript"
import { registerIncludes } from "@galacean/engine-shader";

// Register built-in ShaderLab code segments
registerIncludes();
```

```glsl showLineNumbers filename="ShaderLab"
...
#include "Common.glsl"
#include "BRDF.glsl"
...
```
