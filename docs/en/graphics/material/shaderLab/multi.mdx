title: Multi-Pass Shader Writing  
---

Sometimes, to render a complex effect, we need to perform multiple rendering passes within a single rendering loop. We can organize these related passes under the same `SubShader` for unified management. A Shader containing multiple passes is commonly referred to as a **multi-pass shader**.

As shown below, declare multiple passes required for rendering within a `SubShader`. The engine will render these passes in the order they are declared:

```glsl showLineNumbers {6-8}
SubShader "SubShaderName" {
  ...
  // Global variable area: variable declarations, struct declarations, render state declarations
  ...
 
  Pass "Pass0" { ... }
  Pass "Pass1" { ... }
  Pass "Pass2" { ... }

  ...
}
```

## UsePass

Developers can reuse shader passes using the `UsePass` directive: `UsePass "{pass path}"`. The pass path format is `{ShaderName/SubShaderName/PassName}`. For example, if the following shader pass is declared:

```glsl showLineNumbers {1,3,5}
Shader "water" {
  ...
  SubShader "Default" {
    ...
    Pass "0" {
      ...
    }
    ...
  }
  ...
}
```

Developers can reuse it in other custom shaders via `UsePass "water/Default/0"`.

Additionally, the `UsePass` directive supports reusing built-in engine passes. Currently supported built-in passes include:

| Built-in Shader |           Pass Path           |
| :-------------: | :---------------------------: |
|       PBR       |     pbr/Default/Forward       |
|      Unlit      |    unlit/Default/Forward      |
|     Skybox      |   skybox/Default/Forward      |
| Particle-shader | particle-shader/Default/Forward |
|   SpriteMask    | SpriteMask/Default/Forward    |
|     Sprite      |    Sprite/Default/Forward     |

The `SubShader` is not only used for organizing multiple passes but also supports setting `Tags`, which correspond to the engine's [setTag](/apis/galacean/#SubShader-setTag) API. For example, setting a `ReplaceTag`:

```glsl showLineNumbers
SubShader "SubShaderName" {
  ...
  Tags {ReplaceTag = "opaque"}

  Pass "PassName" {
    ...
  }
}
