After the model is imported, the imported model asset will be added to the **[Asset Panel](/en/docs/assets/interface)**. By clicking on the asset thumbnail, you can see the basic information of this model.

## Sub-assets of the Model

Hover the mouse over the model asset thumbnail and click the triangle button that appears on the right. The mesh, textures, animations, materials, and other sub-asset information contained in the model asset will be displayed in the resource panel.

### Mesh Sub-assets

Click on the mesh sub-asset thumbnail to see the basic information of the mesh as follows:

| Area     | Function       | Explanation               |
| :------- | :------------- | :------------------------ |
| Vertex Data | Vertex Info List | The format and stride of the vertex information |
| Sub-mesh  | Sub-mesh List | Drawing information of the sub-mesh |

### Texture Sub-assets

The only difference between the basic information of texture sub-assets and [texture](/en/docs/graphics/texture/texture/) assets is that the texture information is mostly read-only.

### Material Sub-assets

Similarly, [material](/en/docs/graphics/material/material/) sub-assets work the same way:

In general, users do not need to perform any operations on the materials that come with the model; however, in certain scenarios, developers may want to manually tweak the materials, such as changing the color. In this case, we can duplicate the original material by clicking **duplicate & remap**, and then modify it based on the original material parameters:

### Animation Sub-assets

Animation sub-assets appear in the model assets in the form of [animation clips](/en/docs/animation/clip), and they are also **read-only**.
