> Models are exported in FBX or glTF format using modeling software such as [Blender](https://docs.blender.org/manual/en/2.80/addons/io_scene_gltf2.html), or can be downloaded from model websites such as [Sketchfab](https://sketchfab.com/).

Once the model is ready, you can import it into the Galacean editor for editing. You can import models using the following file formats:

- **(.gltf + .bin + images)**
- **(.glb + images)**
- **(.fbx)**

It should be noted that the editor will convert FBX to a [glTF format](/en/docs/graphics/model/glTF/) that can also be parsed at runtime. Next, let's practice how to import model files into the editor.

## Drag and Drop Import

Drag the model file, or the compressed **.zip** file into the asset panel:

## Button Upload

Click the upper right corner **Asset Panel** -> **GLTF/GLB/FBX**

After the import is complete, the imported model assets will be added to the **[Asset Panel](/en/docs/assets/interface)**. Let's [see what the model assets contain](/en/docs/graphics/model/assets/).
