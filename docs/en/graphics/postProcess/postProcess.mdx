The post-processing system can "process" the results of scene rendering.

## Use post-processing

### 1. Post-processing configuration

Post-processing configuration is uniformly placed in [scene](/en/docs/core/scene) panel, in order to prevent performance waste, the default **turn off**, users only need to turn on the main switch to activate all post-processing effects:

<Callout type="info">
  For specific post-processing effect configuration, please refer to [Post-processing Effect
  List](/en/docs/graphics/postProcess/effects)
</Callout>

<Callout type="warning">
  As of version 1.3, the engine does not expose public APIs (because after supporting post-processing extensions, the
  APIs may change). We recommend that users perform post-processing operations in the editor. If you want to use the
  internal experimental interface, you can call the following code:
</Callout>

```typescript
// Get the post-processing manager
// @ts-ignore
const postProcessManager = scene._postProcessManager;
// Get BloomEffect
const bloomEffect = postProcessManager._bloomEffect as BloomEffect;
// Get TonemappingEffect
const tonemappingEffect = postProcessManager._tonemappingEffect as TonemappingEffect;

// Activate the main switch
postProcessManager.isActive = true;

// Adjust BloomEffect properties
bloomEffect.enabled = true;
bloomEffect.downScale = BloomDownScaleMode.Half;
bloomEffect.threshold = 0.9;
bloomEffect.scatter = 0.7;
bloomEffect.intensity = 1;
bloomEffect.tint.set(1, 1, 1, 1);

// Adjust TonemappingEffect properties
tonemappingEffect.enabled = true;
tonemappingEffect.mode = TonemappingMode.ACES;
```

### 2. Camera switch

The camera preview area is controlled by the **camera component**. In the camera component, the following properties will affect the post-processing effect:

- **Post-processing switch**: You can turn on or off the camera's post-processing effect. The overall switch and specific configuration of post-processing are in the [scene](/en/docs/core/scene) panel.

- **HDR switch**: In HDR mode, the output color is allowed to be stored using floating point numbers, which can obtain a wider range of values ​​for scenes such as [bloom effects](/en/docs/graphics/postProcess/effects).

- **MSAA configuration**: You can adjust the settings of multi-sampling anti-aliasing to improve the quality of the picture such as aliasing.

</Callout>

### 3. Viewport Switch

In addition to the camera preview area, the viewport can also see the post-processing effect. The camera in the viewport is independent, but it also has post-processing switches like the camera component (same as above, also pay attention to the switches in the post-processing configuration); the switches in the viewport only affect the view window and do not affect the actual effect of the project export:

## Recommended configuration for mobile

Generally speaking, some post-processing configurations in the red box in the figure below will affect performance:

And some camera configurations:

- Regarding the `HDR` switch in the camera, if most of the pixel calculations in the scene do not exceed 1 (for example, HDR maps are not used), try not to turn on HDR. After turning it on, the engine will first render to `R11G11B10_UFloat` format In RenderTarget, rendering to the screen again has performance overhead.
- Regarding the `MSAA` option in the camera, it is recommended to adjust this value only when post-processing is turned on and the anti-aliasing performance is strictly required. The larger the value, the greater the performance overhead.
- In the bloom effect, `Down Scale` defaults to `Half`, that is, the initial downsampling resolution is half of the canvas. If the accuracy requirement is not so high, you can switch to `Quarter` and save 1/4 of the canvas.
- In the tone mapping effect, although `ACES` has better color contrast and saturation, the calculation is more complicated, which may cause serious frame drops on low-end models. You can try to use `Neutral` as an alternative.
