The post-processing system can "process" the results rendered by the camera.

## Post-Processing Configuration

There are two modes for post-processing:

- Global Mode: Affects all cameras in the current scene.
- Local Mode: Only effective when the camera is within the collision range of the post-processing entity.

The post-processing component has the following properties to control effects, modes, blending distances, etc.:

| Property | Description |
| :-- | :-- |
| [isGlobal](/apis/core/#PostProcess-isGlobal) | Controls whether this post-processing component is in global or local mode. |
| [Blend Distance](/apis/core/#PostProcess-blendDistance) | In local mode, controls how close the camera must be to the collider before blending effects begins. |
| [Priority](/apis/core/#PostProcess-priority) | When there are multiple post-processing components in the scene, a higher priority means blending/overriding starts later. |
| [Layer](/apis/core/#PostProcess-layer) | Used with the camera's [post-processing mask](/apis/core/#Camera-postProcessMask) to determine which post-processing components are effective. |
| [Add Effect](/apis/core/#PostProcess-addEffect) | Adds post-processing effects. |

## Mixing rules

- In global mode, the mixing rules are based on the post-processing component with the highest priority.

- In local mode, it will start from the **mixing distance** of the camera from the collision body, and transition from the mixed value of the previous post-processing component to the value of the current post-processing component. If there is no previous one, the defined value of the post-processing effect will be used as the starting value.

For example, the intensity is defined as `0`, which is defined by [PostProcessEffectFloatParameter](/apis/core/#PostProcessEffectFloatParameter):

- PostProcessing Component 1: Global mode, intensity is `0.5`, after blending it is `0.5`

- PostProcessing Component 2: Local mode, intensity is `1`, the camera distance to the collider is half of the blend distance, after blending it is `mix( 0.5, 1, 1 - distance / blendDistance)` = `0.75`

## Using Post-Processing

### 1. Adding a Post-Processing Component

In the hierarchy panel, several modes for global and local post-processing are preset; simply select and add to use.

Of course, you can also manually add post-processing components. Local mode needs to be used with colliders:

### 2. Camera Switch

The camera preview area is controlled by the **Camera Component**. In the camera component, the following properties will also affect the post-processing effects:

| Property | Description |
| :-- | :-- |
| [Post-Processing Switch](/apis/core/#Camera-enablePostProcess) | Enables or disables the post-processing effects of the camera. |
| [HDR Switch](/apis/core/#Camera-enableHDR) | In HDR mode, allows output colors to be stored using floating-point numbers, providing a broader range of values for [bloom effects](/en/docs/graphics/postProcess/effects) and other scenarios. |
| [MSAA Configuration](/apis/core/#Camera-msaaSamples) | Adjusts the multi-sampling anti-aliasing settings to improve image quality, such as reducing jagged edges. |
| [Post-Processing Mask](/apis/core/#Camera-postProcessMask) | Works with the post-processing component's [layer](/apis/core/#PostProcess-layer) to determine which post-processing components are effective. |

</Callout>

### 3. Viewport Switch

In addition to the camera preview area, the viewport can also display post-processing effects. The camera in the viewport is independent but has post-processing configurations similar to the camera component.

<Callout type="warning">
  The switch in the viewport only affects the view window and does not impact the actual effect exported in the project.

## Best Practices

- Regarding the `HDR` switch in the camera, if the majority of pixels in the scene do not exceed 1 (e.g., no HDR textures used), avoid enabling HDR. When enabled, the engine first renders to a `R11G11B10_UFloat` format RenderTarget before rendering to the screen, incurring performance overhead.
- Regarding the `MSAA` option in the camera, only adjust this value when post-processing is enabled and strict on anti-aliasing performance. The higher the value, the greater the performance overhead.
- In bloom effects, `Down Scale` defaults to `Half`, meaning the initial downsampled resolution is half that of the canvas. If high precision is not required, switch to `Quarter`, saving to a quarter of the canvas.
- In tone mapping effects, while `ACES` offers better color contrast and saturation, it is computationally complex and may cause significant frame drops on low-end devices. Consider using `Neutral` as an alternative.
