title: Anti Aliasing

Anti-Aliasing (AA) is an image processing technique that aims to reduce the "aliasing" edges in images and make them smoother and more natural.

## FXAA (Fast Approximate Anti-Aliasing)
Fast Approximate Anti-aliasing (FXAA) is an **image-based** fast anti-aliasing algorithm that smoothen edges by detecting edge pixels and blurring jagged areas after the image is rendered.

<Callout type="info">
  While this technique renders quickly, it can slightly blur image details compared to other anti-aliasing techniques.

<Callout type="positive">
 FXAA is an image-based algorithm, which means it can handle all types of aliasing: geometric edges, textures, materials, transparent surfaces.
</Callout>

## MSAA (Multiple Sampling Anti-Aliasing)
MSAA (Multiple Sampling anti-aliasing) is a hardware level anti-aliasing technique that smoothen the aliasing on the edges of the model by performing geometric tests on multiple sub-samples of each pixel to make the final image clearer and more natural.

<Callout type="info">
Materials, textures, and transparent surfaces are not affected by MSAA, which means you can use MSAA with FXAA.
</Callout>

<Callout type="warning">It can be seen that in this scenario, the leaves with transparent clipping (alphaCutoff) are not affected by MSAA, and the opaque bones are affected by MSAA.</Callout>

You can determine the quality of MSAA by setting "msaaSamples" under the camera, or you can set it in your code through the following interface:
```typescript
  camera.msaaSamples = MSAASamples.FourX;
```

## How to use it in the editor?
- Navigate to the Camera Inspector panel and select the desired effectï¼š
