title: Anti Aliasing

Anti-Aliasing (AA) is an image processing technique that aims to reduce the "aliasing" edges in images and make them smoother and more natural.

## FXAA (Fast Approximate Anti-Aliasing)
[Fast Approximate Anti-Aliasing (FXAA)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fast_approximate_anti-aliasing) is screen-space anti-aliasing mode applied after the camera renders the final image,it can smooth all pixels, including by `shader-generated specular`, `alpha-cutoff edge`, `low resolution texture`.

## MSAA (Multiple Sampling Anti-Aliasing)
[Multiple Sampling Anti-Aliasing (MSAA)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multisample_anti-aliasing) is a hardware-level anti-aliasing technology, mainly addressing the jagged edges of geometric shapes. Since jagged edges caused by materials, textures, and transparency and other non-geometric objects are not affected by `MSAA`, this means that you can use `MSAA` and `FXAA` together.

Materials, textures, and transparent surfaces are not affected by MSAA, which means you can use MSAA with FXAA.

<Callout type="warning">It can be seen that in this scenario, the leaves with transparent clipping (alphaCutoff) are not affected by MSAA, and the opaque bones are affected by MSAA.</Callout>

In Galacean, the default 'msaaSamples' under the camera is' 4x'. You can modify the 'msaaSamples' to customize the 'MSAA' quality. Or, you can also set it through the following interface in the code:
```typescript
  camera.msaaSamples = MSAASamples.FourX;
```
