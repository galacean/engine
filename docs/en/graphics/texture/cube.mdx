The difference between a cube texture ([TextureCube](/apis/core/#TextureCube)) and a 2D texture is that it has 6 faces, which means a cube texture is composed of 6 2D textures.

The underlying sampling method of cube textures is slightly different from that of 2D textures. Textures use two-dimensional coordinates for sampling, while cube textures use three-dimensional coordinates, i.e., _direction vectors_ for sampling. For example, using an orange direction vector to sample a texture value from a cube texture would look like this:

Because of this sampling characteristic, cube textures can be used to achieve effects such as skyboxes and environment reflections.

## Creation

> You can download free HDR maps from [Poly Haven](https://polyhaven.com/) or [BimAnt HDRI](http://hdri.bimant.com/)

After preparing the HDR, follow the path **[Asset Panel](/en/docs/assets/interface)** -> **Right-click Upload** -> **Select TextureCube(.hdr)** -> **Choose the corresponding HDR map** -> **Cube texture asset creation completed**.

Similarly, in the script, you can also get the corresponding cube texture by loading six textures in the correct order.

```typescript
const cubeTextureResource = {
  type: AssetType.TextureCube,
  urls: [
    "px - right 图片 url",
    "nx - left 图片 url",
    "py - top 图片 url",
    "ny - bottom 图片 url",
    "pz - front 图片 url",
    "nz - back 图片 url",
  ],
};

engine.resourceManager.load(cubeTextureResource).then((resource) => {
  // 引擎支持的立方纹理
  const cubeTexture = resource;
  // 接下来可以将纹理应用到材质上或者进行其他操作
});
```

## Usage

Cube textures are mainly used in skyboxes. For more details, refer to [Sky Background](/en/docs/graphics/background/sky/)
