Textures ([Texture](/apis/core/#Texture)) are one of the most commonly used resources in 3D rendering. When shading a model, we need to set a color value for each fragment. Besides setting the color value manually, we can also choose to read texels from a texture for shading to achieve richer artistic effects.

> It is worth noting that images, canvas, raw data, videos, etc., can all be used as textures. The Galacean engine currently supports all WebGL standard textures.

We will find that many issues in the engine stem from mapping between different spaces (such as MVP transformations). Textures are no exception. Developers need to understand the mapping relationship from image space to texture space and the mapping rules from texels to pixels.

This article will mainly introduce:

## Texture Types

| Type                                     | Description                                                        |
| :--------------------------------------- | :----------------------------------------------------------------- |
| [2D Textures](/en/docs/graphics/texture/2d/)    | The most commonly used artistic resource, sampled using 2D UV coordinates                         |
| [Cube Textures](/en/docs/graphics/texture/cube/) | Composed of 6 2D textures, can be used to achieve skybox, environment reflection effects |
| 2D Texture Arrays                              | Occupies only one texture unit, very suitable for implementing texture atlas switching needs         |

## Texture Space

Texture space is determined by the shape of the texture. 2D textures require 2D space vectors for texture sampling, while cube textures require 3D space vectors for texture sampling.

## Common Properties

Although there are various types of textures, they all have some similar basic properties and settings:

| Property                                                            | Value                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| :-------------------------------------------------------------- | :----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Wrap Mode U ([wrapModeU](/apis/core/#Texture-wrapModeU))         | Clamp Mode ([Clamp](/apis/core/#TextureWrapMode-Clamp)), Repeat Mode ([Repeat](/apis/core/#TextureWrapMode-Repeat)), Mirror Repeat Mode ([Mirror](/apis/core/#TextureWrapMode-Mirror))               |
| Wrap Mode V ([wrapModeV](/apis/core/#Texture-wrapModeV))         | Clamp Mode ([Clamp](/apis/core/#TextureWrapMode-Clamp)), Repeat Mode ([Repeat](/apis/core/#TextureWrapMode-Repeat)), Mirror Repeat Mode ([Mirror](/apis/core/#TextureWrapMode-Mirror))               |
| Filter Mode ([filterMode](/apis/core/#Texture-filterMode))         | Point Filter ([Point](/apis/core/#TextureFilterMode-Point)), Bilinear Filter ([Bilinear](/apis/core/#TextureFilterMode-Bilinear)), Trilinear Filter ([Trilinear](/apis/core/#TextureFilterMode-Trilinear)) |
| Anisotropic Filter Level ([anisoLevel](/apis/core/#Texture-anisoLevel)) | 1 ~ 16, depending on device support                                                                                                                                                               |

### Loop Mode

The texture sampling range is `[0,1]`. When the texture UV coordinates exceed this range, we can control how the exceeding part is sampled by setting the loop mode.

| Sampling Loop Mode | Explanation                          |
| :----------------- | :----------------------------------- |
| Clamp              | Samples the edge texel when out of range |
| Repeat             | Resamples from [0,1] when out of range |
| Mirror             | Mirrors sampling from [1,0] when out of range |

### Filter Mode

Generally, texels and screen pixels do not correspond exactly. We can control the filtering mode in magnification (Mag) and minification (Min) modes by setting the filter mode.

| Sampling Filter Mode | Explanation                                                   |
| :------------------- | :------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Point                | Uses the texel closest to the sampling point                  |
| Bilinear             | Uses the average value of the nearest 2\*2 texel matrix       |
| Trilinear            | Applies average filtering to the mipmap levels based on bilinear filtering |

### Anisotropic Filtering Level

Anisotropic filtering technology can make textures appear clearer when viewed at oblique angles. As shown in the figure below, the end of the texture becomes clearer as the anisotropic filtering level increases. However, use it with caution; the higher the value, the greater the GPU computation.

## General Settings

| Setting           | Value                        |
| :---------------- | :--------------------------- |
| mipmap            | Multi-level texture gradient (enabled by default) |
| flipY             | Flip Y-axis (disabled by default) |
| premultiplyAlpha  | Premultiply alpha channel (disabled by default) |
| format            | Texture format (default R8G8B8A8) |

### mipmap

**The engine enables [mipmap](/apis/core/#Texture-generateMipmaps)** (multi-level texture gradient) by default. Mipmap is used to solve the precision and performance issues when sampling high-resolution textures on low-resolution screens, allowing the selection of different resolution textures at appropriate distances, as shown below:

![image.png](https://gw.alipayobjects.com/mdn/rms_d27172/afts/img/A*mTBvTJ7Czt4AAAAAAAAAAAAAARQnAQ)

It should be noted that WebGL2.0 supports textures of **any resolution** and will generate mip levels based on the [mipmap](http://download.nvidia.com/developer/Papers/2005/NP2_Mipmapping/NP2_Mipmap_Creation.pdf) algorithm. However, if your environment is WebGL1.0, please ensure to upload **power-of-two textures**, such as textures with a resolution of 1024 \* 512. Otherwise, Galacean will detect that the environment cannot use mipmap and will automatically downgrade to disable the mipmap function, which may cause some unexpected visual effects.

If you need to change the default behavior of mipmap, you can do so via script. For parameters, see [API](/apis/core/#Texture2D-constructor):

```typescript
const texture = new Texture2D(
  engine,
  width,
  height,
  TextureFormat.R8G8B8A8,
  false
); // 第 5 个参数
```

For cube texture scripts, see [API](/apis/core/#TextureCube-constructor):

```typescript
const cubeTexture = new TextureCube(
  engine,
  size,
  TextureFormat.R8G8B8A8,
  false
); // 第 4 个参数
```

<playground src="texture-mipmap.ts"></playground>

### flipY

flipY is used to control whether the texture is flipped along the Y-axis, i.e., upside down. **The engine and editor disable it by default**. If you need to change the default behavior of flipY, you can do so via the [setImageSource](/apis/core/#Texture2D-setImageSource) method:

```typescript
const texture = new Texture2D(engine, width, height);
texture.setImageSource(img, 0, true); // The 3rd parameter
```

### premultiplyAlpha

premultiplyAlpha is used to control whether the texture pre-multiplies the alpha (transparency) channel. **The engine and editor have it turned off by default**. If you need to change the default behavior of premultiplyAlpha, you can do so through the [setImageSource](/apis/core/#Texture2D-setImageSource) method:

```typescript
const texture = new Texture2D(engine, width, height);
texture.setImageSource(img, 0, undefined, true); // The 4th parameter
```

### format

The engine uses `TextureFormat.R8G8B8A8` as the default texture format, meaning that the red, green, blue, and alpha channels each use 1 byte, allowing each channel to store color values ranging from 0 to 255. The engine supports configuring different texture formats, which can be referenced in [TextureFormat](/apis/core/#TextureFormat). For example, if we do not need to use the alpha channel, i.e., the A channel, we can use `TextureFormat.R8G8B8`:

```typescript
const texture = new Texture2D(engine, width, height, TextureFormat.R8G8B8);
```
```
