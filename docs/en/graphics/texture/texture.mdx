## Texture Overview

Textures ([Texture](/apis/core/#Texture)) are one of the most commonly used resources in 3D rendering. By using textures, we can set color values for each fragment of a model, achieving richer artistic effects. Textures can come from images, canvas elements, raw data, videos, etc. The Galacean engine supports all WebGL standard textures.

<Callout type="info">
  The use of textures involves spatial mapping (e.g., MVP transformations). Developers need to understand the mapping relationship from image space to texture space, as well as the mapping rules from texels to pixels.

## Purpose of Textures

The main purposes of textures in 3D rendering include:

- Adding colors and details to models, such as base textures and normal maps.
- Creating effects like [skyboxes](/en/docs/graphics/background/sky/) and environmental reflections.
- [Playing videos through textures](/en/docs/graphics/texture/2d/).
- Improving performance through optimization techniques like [compressed textures](/en/docs/graphics/texture/compression/).

## Texture Types

| Type                                     | Description                                                        |
| :--------------------------------------- | :----------------------------------------------------------------- |
| [2D Textures](/en/docs/graphics/texture/2d/)    | The most commonly used artistic resource, sampled using 2D UV coordinates. |
| [Cube Textures](/en/docs/graphics/texture/cube/) | Composed of 6 2D textures, used to create skyboxes and environmental reflection effects. |
| [2D Texture Arrays](/apis/core/#Texture2DArray) | Occupies only one texture unit, ideal for scenarios requiring texture atlas switching. |

## Properties

### sRGB
Determines whether the texture data is in the sRGB color space. The default is `true`. For linear data like normal maps, this option should be disabled. For more details, see [Color Space](/en/docs/core/color/).

### Mipmap

**Mipmap generation is enabled by default in the engine ([mipmap](/apis/core/#Texture-generateMipmaps))**, which improves performance and precision when sampling high-resolution textures on low-resolution screens. WebGL 2.0 supports textures of any resolution, but in WebGL 1.0 environments, **power-of-two textures** (e.g., 1024x512) must be uploaded; otherwise, mipmap will be automatically disabled.

### Filter Modes

Texels and screen pixels usually do not correspond exactly. Filter modes can control the sampling method when magnifying (Mag) or minifying (Min) textures:

| Sampling Filter Mode | Description                                              |
| :------------------- | :------------------------------------------------------- |
| Point                | Uses the texel closest to the sampling point.            |
| Bilinear             | Uses the average value of the nearest 2x2 texel matrix.  |
| Trilinear            | Adds average filtering across mipmap levels on top of bilinear filtering. |

---

### Wrap Modes

The sampling range of a texture is `[0,1]`. When UV coordinates exceed this range, wrap modes can control the sampling behavior:

| Sampling Wrap Mode | Description                          |
| :----------------- | :----------------------------------- |
| Clamp              | Samples the edge texel when out of range. |
| Repeat             | Restarts sampling from `[0,1]` when out of range. |
| Mirror             | Mirrors sampling from `[1,0]` when out of range. |

### Anisotropic Filtering Level

Anisotropic filtering improves texture clarity when viewed at oblique angles. The level ranges from 1 to 16, depending on device support.

### Texture Compression and Project Publishing

All textures in the project can be globally configured during [project publishing](/en/docs/platform/platform):

Individual textures can also be configured. For more details, see [Texture Compression](/en/docs/graphics/texture/compression/).
