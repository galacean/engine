Galacean supports developers to query the current keyboard interaction status at any time, and the interface is very simple to call.

## Methods

| Method Name                                               | Description                |
| --------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------- |
| [isKeyHeldDown](/apis/core/#InputManager-isKeyHeldDown) | Returns whether the key is being held down |
| [isKeyDown](/apis/core/#InputManager-isKeyDown)         | Returns whether the key was pressed in the current frame |
| [isKeyUp](/apis/core/#InputManager-isKeyUp)             | Returns whether the key was released in the current frame |

## Quick Start

Below is a simple example of detecting key states.

```typescript
class KeyScript extends Script {
  onUpdate() {
    const { inputManager } = this.engine;
    if (inputManager.isKeyHeldDown(Keys.Space)) {
      // 现在还按着空格键
    }
    if (inputManager.isKeyDown(Keys.Space)) {
      // 这帧按下过空格键
    }
    if (inputManager.isKeyUp(Keys.Space)) {
      // 这帧抬起过空格键
    }
  }
}
```

## Practical Example

This time, let's use the spacebar to control Angry Birds.

## State Dictionary

| Key State                   | isKeyHeldDown | isKeyDown | isKeyUp |
| --------------------------- | ------------- | --------- | ------- |
| The key has been held down since the last frame | true          | false     | false   |
| The key was pressed in the current frame and not released | true          | true      | false   |
| The key was released and pressed again in the current frame | true          | true      | true    |
| The key was pressed and released in the current frame | false         | true      | true    |
| The key was released in the current frame | false         | false     | true    |
| The key was not pressed and had no interaction | false         | false     | false   |
| This situation will not occur | true          | false     | true    |
| This situation will not occur | false         | true      | false   |

## Keys

The keyboard Keys enumerated by Galacean correspond one-to-one with the physical keyboard, following W3C standards, and are compatible with various special keys on different hardware.
