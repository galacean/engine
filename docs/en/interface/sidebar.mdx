### Create/Clone Project

Selecting the **New Project** option allows you to choose from different types of new projects. Clicking **Fork** will redirect you to the newly cloned project page, while the old project will still be retained.

### Project Settings

Clicking the **Project Settings** option will bring up a popup with basic project settings.

Basic project settings include:

- **Engine Version**: Upgrade engine version to quickly fix a bug or enjoy new features.
- **Physics Backend**: The physics engine backend, with options to choose between _Physics Lite_ or _PhysX_. The former is a lightweight physics engine, while the latter is a high-end physics engine based on [PhysX](https://developer.nvidia.com/physx-sdk).
- **Model Import Options**: Model import options include options for computing tangents and removing lights.

## Panel Layout

Users can use this menu to bring up hidden panels and save the current panel layout according to their usage habits, making it convenient to use the same layout for other projects.

## Project Export

## Snapshot Management

The snapshot management feature allows users to save snapshots of a project to the history, in case issues like data loss occur. Users can select **Add Snapshot** from the menu.

Snapshots display information such as name, engine version, and author. By clicking on the snapshot name, users can edit it to make it easier to find next time. You can quickly restore to a previously saved snapshot using **Revert** or delete snapshots you do not wish to keep using **Delete**.

It's worth noting that if the engine version is upgraded in the project settings, the system will automatically save a snapshot of the original version of the project. If the upgrade causes the project to become inaccessible, you can revert to the original version from the project settings on the project list page.
