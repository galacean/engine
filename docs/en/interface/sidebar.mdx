The main menu can be summoned by clicking the first button on the sidebar. It provides project settings, options to create/clone projects, and some editing options.

### Create/Clone Project

Select the **New Project** option to further choose different types of projects to create. Clicking **Fork** will redirect you to the newly cloned project page, while the old project remains intact.

### Project Settings

Clicking the **Project Settings** option will bring up the basic project settings dialog.

Basic project settings include:

- **Engine Version**: Upgrade the engine version to quickly fix a bug or enjoy new features.
- **Physics Backend**: Choose between _Physics Lite_ or _PhysX_ as the physics engine backend. The former is a lightweight physics engine, while the latter is an advanced engine based on [PhysX](https://developer.nvidia.com/physx-sdk).
- **Model Import Options**: Options for model import, including calculating tangents and removing lights.

<Callout type="warning">Engine version upgrades are irreversible. To prevent project damage, a snapshot will be automatically saved during the engine upgrade process.</Callout>

For quick project settings, you can also access them from the project list page.

## Panel Layout

This menu allows you to call up hidden panels or save the current panel layout according to your usage habits, making it convenient to use the same layout for other projects.

## Member Management

You can search for new members via email and assign them three permission levels: read/write, read-only, and edit. After successfully adding them, you can still edit the member's permission levels or remove the member. Additionally, you can generate a project invitation link that is valid for 7 days; users who click on this link can directly join the project.

Please note that we currently do not support multiple users editing the same project simultaneously. We will support collaborative editing in future versions.

<Callout>Each project can have a maximum of 5 collaborators</Callout>

## Project Export

For details, see [Multi-platform Export](/en/docs/platform/platform).

## Snapshot Management

The snapshot management feature allows users to save snapshots of a project to the history, in case issues like data loss occur. Users can select **Add Snapshot** from the menu.

Snapshots display information such as name, engine version, and author. By clicking on the snapshot name, users can edit it to make it easier to find next time. You can quickly restore to a previously saved snapshot using **Revert** or delete snapshots you do not wish to keep using **Delete**.

<Callout type="info">If the engine version is upgraded in the project settings, the system will automatically save a snapshot of the original version of the project. If the upgrade causes the project to become inaccessible, you can revert to the original version from the project settings on the project list page.</Callout>
