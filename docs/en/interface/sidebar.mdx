### Create/Clone Project

Selecting the **New Project** option allows you to choose from different types of new projects. Clicking **Fork** will redirect you to the newly cloned project page, while the old project will still be retained.

### Project Settings

Clicking the **Project Settings** option will bring up a popup with basic project settings.

Basic project settings include:

- **Engine Version**: Upgrade engine version to quickly fix a bug or enjoy new features.
- **Physics Backend**: The physics engine backend, with options to choose between _Physics Lite_ or _PhysX_. The former is a lightweight physics engine, while the latter is a high-end physics engine based on [PhysX](https://developer.nvidia.com/physx-sdk).
- **Model Import Options**: Model import options include options for computing tangents and removing lights.

## Snapshot Management

The snapshot management feature allows users to save a snapshot of a project into the history, so in case of data loss or other issues, you can quickly restore to a previously saved snapshot through **Revert**. Users can choose **Add Snapshot** from the menu. Clicking on the snapshot name allows you to edit the snapshot name for easy quick retrieval next time.
