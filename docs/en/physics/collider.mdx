The biggest advantage of introducing a physics engine is that it allows objects in the scene to have physical responses. Colliders ([Collider](/apis/core/#Collider)) are a type of component in the engine, and there are currently two types. Before using them, we need to understand these two types of colliders:

1. [StaticCollider](/apis/core/#StaticCollider): Static collider, mainly used for stationary objects in the scene;
2. [DynamicCollider](/apis/core/#DynamicCollider): Dynamic collider, used for objects in the scene that need to be controlled by scripts or respond to physical feedback.

## Editor Usage

### Adding Collider Component

Before adding a physics component to an object, the first thing to consider is whether the collider is static or dynamic, and then add the corresponding collider component, either a static collider [StaticCollider](/apis/core/#StaticCollider) or a dynamic collider [DynamicCollider](/apis/core/#DynamicCollider).

### Selecting the Shape of the Collider

Next, we need to add a [ColliderShape](/apis/core/#ColliderShape) to the collider component. In fact, each `Collider` is a collection of [ColliderShape](/apis/core/#ColliderShape), meaning each `Collider` can be set to a composite collider shape by combining [ColliderShape](/apis/core/#ColliderShape).

Currently, four types of `ColliderShape` are supported, but the support varies among different backend physics packages, as detailed below:

| Name | Description       | Supported Backend Physics Packages                    |
| :--- |:---------|:----------------------------|
| [BoxColliderShape](/apis/core/#BoxColliderShape) | Box-shaped collider   | physics-lite, physics-physx |
| [SphereColliderShape](/apis/core/#SphereColliderShape) | Sphere-shaped collider   | physics-lite, physics-physx |
| [PlaneColliderShape](/apis/core/#PlaneColliderShape) | Unbounded plane collider | physics-physx               |
| [CapsuleColliderShape](/apis/core/#CapsuleColliderShape) | Capsule-shaped collider   | physics-physx               |

The engine supports composite collider shapes, meaning the collider itself can be composed of `BoxColliderShape`, `SphereColliderShape`, and `CapsuleColliderShape`.

It is particularly emphasized here the positional relationship between `Collider` and `ColliderShape`. The posture of each `Collider` is consistent with the `Entity` it is attached to, and they are synchronized every frame. The `ColliderShape` can set an offset **relative to** the `Entity` through the `position` property.

After adding the collider component, the collider shape is not added by default, so you need to click Add Item to add it. After adding, you will see the auxiliary rendering of the collider appear in the viewport.

For each collider shape, you can design corresponding size properties. For example:

<Image src="https://mdn.alipayobjects.com/huamei_3zduhr/afts/img/A*d4MCRbuHeMsAAAAAAAAAAAAADsJ_AQ/original" alt="alt text" style={{ zoom: "67%" }} />

No matter which collider shape is used, you can set the Local Position, which is the local offset relative to the Entity coordinates.

The `ColliderShape` also has a noteworthy property called `Trigger`, which can switch this `ColliderShape` from `collider mode` to `trigger mode`.

Trigger mode: The object does not have a rigid body shape, but can trigger specific script functions when contact occurs.
Collider mode: The object has a rigid body shape, and when contact occurs, it can not only trigger script functions but also change its original motion according to physical laws.

### Dynamic Collider Settings
Unlike static colliders, dynamic colliders are subject to physical laws, so there are many additional physical properties to set.

<Image src="https://mdn.alipayobjects.com/huamei_3zduhr/afts/img/A*7rzqSKtjULMAAAAAAAAAAAAADsJ_AQ/original" alt="alt text" style={{ zoom: "67%" }} />

After modifying these parameters, the viewport will not change because dynamic colliders are subject to gravity by default, so you need to observe them in `preview mode`.

### Note
- The determined collision area should be as simple as possible to improve the performance of the physics engine detection.
- The reference coordinate system of the collider is the coordinate system of the subordinate Entity.
- PlaneColliderShape represents a full plane, so there are no auxiliary lines displayed, and it is generally used as a floor.

## Script Usage

### Adding a Collider
``` typescript
  // 添加静态碰撞器
  const boxCollider = boxEntity.addComponent(StaticCollider);
  // 添加动态碰撞器
  const sphereCollider = sphereEntity.addComponent(DynamicCollider);
```

### Adding a ColliderShape
``` typescript
  const boxCollider = boxEntity.getComponent(StaticCollider);
  const physicsBox = new BoxColliderShape();
  physicsBox.size = new Vector3(1, 1, 1);
  boxCollider.addShape(physicsBox);

  //设置 Trigger
  physicsBox.isTrigger = true;
```

For these two types, corresponding functions are provided in the script.

### Trigger Script Functions

For trigger mode, you first need to add a `Collider` to the `Entity` in the scene; when these components come into contact, three functions in the script component will be automatically triggered:

1. [onTriggerEnter](/en/docs/script#$1-ontriggerenter): Called when contact occurs.
2. [onTriggerStay](/en/docs/script#$1-ontriggerstay): *Loop* called during contact.
3. [onTriggerExit](/en/docs/script#$1-ontriggerexit): Called when contact ends.

You can enable trigger mode through the `isTrigger` property on `ColliderShape`, but it is particularly emphasized that **trigger events will not be called between two StaticColliders**, unless one of them is a `DynamicCollider`.

### Collider Script Functions

For collider mode, when `DynamicColliders` interact, three collision-related script functions will be triggered:
1. [onCollisionEnter](/en/docs/script#$1-oncollisionenter): Called when a collision occurs.
2. [onCollisionStay](/en/docs/script#$1-oncollisionstay): *Loop* called during the collision.
3. [onCollisionExit](/en/docs/script#$1-oncollisionexit): Called when the collision ends.
