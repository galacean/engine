Collider ([Collider](/apis/core/#Collider)) is a component used to detect and respond to physical collisions. The engine provides the following types of colliders:

| Type | Description | Applicable Scenarios |
| --- | --- | --- |
| [**StaticCollider**](/apis/core/#StaticCollider) | Static collider, does not move but can collide with other objects | Ground, walls, and other static objects |
| [**DynamicCollider**](/apis/core/#DynamicCollider) | Dynamic collider, affected by the physics engine and can move freely | Movable objects, projectiles, etc. |
| [**CharacterController**](/apis/core/#CharacterController) | Collider specifically for character control | Player characters, NPCs, etc. |

Collider components are used to define the physical properties and collision behavior of objects. The Galacean physics system provides three types of colliders:

1. [Dynamic Collider](/docs/physics/collider/dynamicCollider)  
   Dynamic colliders can move freely and are affected by physical forces, suitable for movable objects that require physical simulation, such as projectiles and pushable boxes.

2. [Static Collider](/docs/physics/collider/staticCollider)  
   Static colliders are fixed in the scene and do not move, typically used to create fixed physical obstacles such as ground and walls.

3. [Character Controller](/docs/physics/collider/characterController)  
   Character controllers are colliders specifically designed for character movement, supporting features such as walking on slopes and climbing steps, suitable for character control in first-person or third-person games.

## Basic Concepts

All collider types have the following common features:

1. **Shape Management**: Each collider can contain multiple [collision shapes](/docs/physics/collider/colliderShape) (character controllers can only add one). For detailed instructions on collision shapes, please refer to the [Collision Shape](/docs/physics/collider/colliderShape) documentation.

Currently, four types of `collision shapes` are supported, but the support varies among different backend physics packages, as shown below:

| Name                                                     | Description             | Supported Backend Physics Packages             |
| :------------------------------------------------------- | :--------------- | :--------------------------- |
| [BoxColliderShape](/apis/core/#BoxColliderShape)         | Box-shaped collision shape     | physics-lite, physics-physx |
| [SphereColliderShape](/apis/core/#SphereColliderShape)   | Sphere-shaped collision shape     | physics-lite, physics-physx |
| [PlaneColliderShape](/apis/core/#PlaneColliderShape)     | Infinite plane collision shape | physics-physx                |
| [CapsuleColliderShape](/apis/core/#CapsuleColliderShape) | Capsule-shaped collision shape     | physics-physx                |

2. **Transform Synchronization**:

   - Colliders automatically synchronize the world transform of the entity, including position, rotation, and scale
   - `Collision shapes` can be set with local offsets and rotations relative to the entity

3. **Trigger Mode**: `Collision shapes` can be set to trigger mode, where overlapping does not produce physical reactions but triggers corresponding trigger events

- Trigger mode can be enabled/disabled by setting the isTrigger property of the `collision shape`

4. **Collider Mode VS Trigger Mode**:
   - Collider Mode: Triggers collider events and has actual physical collision effects
   - Trigger Mode: Only triggers trigger event callbacks without physical collision

<Callout type="positive">
Collider mode and trigger mode are properties of collision shapes. A collider can contain multiple collision shapes, each of which can be independently set as a trigger. This means:
A collider can have both modes simultaneously, with some shapes set to collider mode and others to trigger mode, allowing for both physical collisions and area detection
</Callout>

### Collision/Trigger Event Callbacks
When two colliders collide or trigger overlaps occur, callback functions in [scripts](/docs/script/script) attached to the entity owning the collider will be triggered, as follows:

#### Collider Event Callbacks
| Event Name                                                  | Trigger Timing       |
| ----------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------- |
| [**onCollisionEnter**](/apis/core/#Script-onCollisionEnter) | Triggered when collision starts       |
| [**onCollisionExit**](/apis/core/#Script-onCollisionExit)   | Triggered when collision ends       |
| [**onCollisionStay**](/apis/core/#Script-onCollisionStay)   | Triggered when collision continues       |

#### Trigger Event Callbacks
| Event Name                                                  | Trigger Timing       |
| ----------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------- |
| [**onTriggerEnter**](/apis/core/#Script-onTriggerEnter)     | Triggered when entering the trigger     |
| [**onTriggerExit**](/apis/core/#Script-onTriggerExit)       | Triggered when exiting the trigger     |
| [**onTriggerStay**](/apis/core/#Script-onTriggerStay)       | Triggered when staying inside the trigger |

## Best Practices

1. **Reasonable Use of Shapes**

- Minimize the number of collision shapes, adding additional shapes only when necessary to reduce performance overhead
- Avoid using too many collision shapes
- Use simplified collision shapes instead of precise meshes for complex models
- Capsule shapes are recommended for character controllers as they handle steps and slopes better

2. **Performance Optimization**

   - Set immovable objects as static colliders
   - Merge adjacent static colliders
   - Adjust the solverIterations of dynamic colliders appropriately to balance performance and accuracy
   - Use CollisionDetectionMode wisely, enabling continuous collision detection only when necessary

3. **Dynamic Collider Settings**

   - Adjust linearDamping and angularDamping based on the object's mass to avoid unnatural movement
   - Use constraints to restrict unnecessary degrees of freedom and improve stability
   - Set sleepThreshold appropriately to let stationary objects enter sleep mode in time

4. **Character Controller Configuration**

   - Set an appropriate stepOffset based on the game type to avoid getting stuck or crossing unreasonable steps
   - Set an appropriate slopeLimit considering the slope angles in the game scene
   - Choose a suitable nonWalkableMode considering whether sliding effects are needed
   - Ensure the collision shape matches the character's visual model reasonably

5. **Usage Scenarios**
   - Static Colliders: Scene boundaries, terrain, buildings, and other fixed objects
   - Dynamic Colliders: Pushable objects, physical props, destructible objects, etc.
   - Character Controllers: Player characters, NPCs, and other objects requiring special movement control

## Script Usage

### Adding Colliders

```typescript
// Add a static collider
const staticCollider = entity.addComponent(StaticCollider);

// Add a dynamic collider
const dynamicCollider = entity.addComponent(DynamicCollider);

// Add a character controller
const characterController = entity.addComponent(CharacterController);
```
