Joint components are used to simulate connections between colliders or between a collider and an arbitrary point in world space. By applying forces to restrict degrees of freedom, they achieve specific physical effects. Currently, Galacean supports three types of joint components:

1. [Fixed Joint](/docs/physics/joint/fixedJoint)  
   A fixed joint completely restricts the relative motion between two colliders, maintaining their fixed relative position and orientation. This type of joint is particularly useful when you need separable objects or synchronized motion without a hierarchical structure.

2. [Spring Joint](/docs/physics/joint/springJoint)  
   A spring joint uses spring force and damping to maintain the distance between two objects. It allows objects to move freely within a certain range and applies elastic constraint forces when they exceed that range, similar to having a spring between them.

3. [Hinge Joint](/docs/physics/joint/hingeJoint)  
   A hinge joint allows objects to rotate freely around a fixed axis, commonly used for implementing door hinges, wheels, pendulums, and other physical effects requiring rotation around a fixed axis.

## Basic Concepts

All joint types share the following common characteristics:

1. **Joint Endpoints**: Each joint involves two acting objects:
   - Main collider: The collider with the joint component attached
   - Connected object: The target collider specified by the `connectedCollider` property or a point in world space

2. **Anchor Settings**:
   - `anchor`: The connection point on the main collider
   - `connectedAnchor`: The connection point on the target object

3. **Break Thresholds**:
   - `breakForce`: Maximum force the joint can withstand
   - `breakTorque`: Maximum torque the joint can withstand

4. **Physics Calculation Intervention**:
    - `connectedMassScale` and `massScale`: Used to adjust the mass influence of connected and main colliders

## Script Usage

### Creating Joints

You can dynamically create and configure joint components through scripts:

```typescript
// Create a fixed joint
const fixedJoint = entity.addComponent(FixedJoint);

// Create a spring joint
const springJoint = entity.addComponent(SpringJoint);

// Create a hinge joint
const hingeJoint = entity.addComponent(HingeJoint);
```

### Setting Connection Objects

All joints can set connection targets and anchor points:

```typescript
// Set the target collider to connect to
joint.connectedCollider = targetEntity.getComponent(Collider);

// Set the joint's anchor point on the main collider
joint.anchor.setValue(0, 1, 0);

// Set the joint's connection point on the target collider
joint.connectedAnchor.setValue(0, 0, 0);
```

### Common Property Configuration

All joint types support the following settings:

```typescript
// Set break force and torque
joint.breakForce = 1000;
joint.breakTorque = 1000;

// Set mass influence
joint.massScale = 1.0;
joint.connectedMassScale = 1.0;

// Set whether to automatically calculate connection points
joint.automaticConnectedAnchor = true;
```
