The PhysicsScene ([PhysicsScene](/apis/core/#PhysicsScene)) manages all physics components in the scene and communicates with the physics backend, implementing global operations related to the PhysicsScene, such as updates and ray casting. In multi-scene projects, each [Scene](/apis/core/Scene) has its own PhysicsScene, and physics systems between Scenes are isolated and do not affect each other.

## Physics Update

The PhysicsScene and rendering scene are independent but continuously synchronize their data during program execution. Therefore, like [scripts](/docs/script/script), the timing of synchronization is also very important. The update frequency of the PhysicsScene differs from the rendering scene and is controlled by the following parameter:
```typescript
/** The fixed update time step (seconds) of the PhysicsScene */
fixedTimeStep: number = 1 / 60;
```

### Update Mechanism

- In each rendering frame, the physics engine updates according to the fixed time step [fixedTimeStep](/apis/core/#PhysicsScene-fixedTimeStep)
- If the actual frame interval is greater than `fixedTimeStep`:
  - Multiple physics updates will be performed until catching up with the actual time
  - The maximum update time per frame is limited by `engine.time.maximumDeltaTime`
- If the actual frame interval is less than `fixedTimeStep`, it accumulates to the next frame

### Physics Update Callback

For physics component updates, you need to use a dedicated callback function in [scripts](/docs/script/script):
```typescript
export class Script extends Component {
  /**
   * Called before physics calculations, the number of calls depends on the physics update frequency
   */
  onPhysicsUpdate(): void {}
}
```

The position of the physics update in the entire update process can be referred to in the figure below

### Internal Update Process of the Physics System

The execution order when the PhysicsScene is updated:

1. Execute user logic in `onPhysicsUpdate`
2. `callColliderOnUpdate` synchronizes the modified [Entity](/apis/core/#Entity) `Transform` data to the physics collider
3. Update the PhysicsScene
4. `callColliderOnLateUpdate` synchronizes the updated positions of all [colliders](/docs/physics/collider/overview) to the corresponding `Entity`

## Setting Scene Gravity

The PhysicsScene allows customization of gravity direction and magnitude. Gravity affects all [dynamic colliders](/docs/physics/collider/dynamicCollider) with gravity enabled in the scene.

```typescript
// Get the gravity value of the PhysicsScene
const gravity = scene.physics.gravity;

// Modify gravity - set gravity to 0
scene.physics.gravity.set(0, 0, 0);

// Modify gravity - set to Earth's gravitational acceleration (default value)
scene.physics.gravity.set(0, -9.81, 0);
```

## Using Raycasting

A ray can be understood as an infinite line emitted from a point in a certain direction in the 3D world. Raycasting is widely used in 3D applications:

- Used to pick objects in the 3D scene when the user clicks the screen
- Used in shooting games to determine if a bullet can hit the target
- Detect visibility and occlusion relationships between objects

### Raycasting Example

To use raycasting, follow these steps:

1. Import necessary modules such as [Ray](/apis/math/Ray)
2. Create a ray (can be customized or generated through [camera.screenPointToRay](/apis/core/#Camera-screenPointToRay))
3. Call the [`raycast`](/apis/core/#PhysicsScene-raycast) method to detect collisions
```typescript
// Load the Raycast module
import { WebGLEngine, HitResult, Ray } from "@galacean/engine";
import { LitePhysics } from "@galacean/engine-physics-lite";

const engine = await WebGLEngine.create({
  canvas: "canvas",
  physics: new LitePhysics()
});
engine.canvas.resizeByClientSize();
const scene = engine.scenes[0];
// Convert screen input to Ray
document.getElementById("canvas").addEventListener("click", (e) => {
  const ratio = window.devicePixelRatio;
  let ray = new Ray();
  camera.screenPointToRay(new Vector2(e.offsetX, e.offsetY).scale(ratio), ray);
  const hit = new HitResult();
  result = scene.physics.raycast(ray, Number.MAX_VALUE, Layer.Everything, hit);
  if (result) {
    console.log(hit.entity.name);
  }
});
```

### Notes

- Entity must add [collider](/docs/physics/collider/overview) components to be detected by raycasting
- When a ray hits multiple [collider shapes](/docs/physics/collider/colliderShape) at the same distance, it will return the Entity of the collider shape that was added first
- It is recommended to use [InputManager](/docs/input/input/) to handle input, as it provides a more convenient way to handle input
