## The tests

We have designed a set of test schemes to compare the performance of various game engines across multiple performance factors. All tests are conducted in the following environment:

-  Macbook M2 Pro
-  Memory 16GB
-  Sonoma 14.4.1

All tests are run in a production environment. Like the engines, our benchmark test code is also open source. You can access the source code at the [benchmark](https://github.com/galacean/benchmark) repository. This test includes the Galacean Engine, Babylon.js, and Three.js engines.

### Basic Rendering

In this benchmark, we tested the initialization time for three engines with a scene containing 225 glTF models, and the performance while simultaneously playing 255 glTF animations.

### Particle System

In this benchmark, we tested the rendering performance of three engines using 500 particle systems with similar parameters against an opaque background.

<BenchmarkDisplay type="particle" />

> Three.js itself does not have a Particle System nor a currently maintained preferred third-party library. Similar effects are typically implemented by developers independently. Therefore, we use `three-nebula` to represent the Three.js particle system in this test.

### 2D Rendering

In the 2D test, we tested the performance of placing 7920 2D sprites and rotating them simultaneously.

## Conclusion

We chose to test with Babylon.js, Three.js and PixiJS as they are some of the most popular game engines and have been benchmarks we strive to surpass throughout the development process. We hope to provide transparent and comparable performance information to the community through these benchmarks.
