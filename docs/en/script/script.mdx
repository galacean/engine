In addition to the [built-in components](/en/docs/core/component/), the Galacean engine also provides a powerful scripting system. The scripting system is the bridge between the engine's capabilities and game logic. It extends from the [Script](/apis/galacean/#Script) base class. You can extend the engine's functionality through custom scripts, and write your own game logic code in the lifecycle hook functions provided by the script components.

In this chapter, you will learn about:

- [Script Class](/en/docs/script/class/): The lifecycle of script callbacks and how to control entities with scripts
- Script Workflow
	- [Create Script](/en/docs/script/create/): Declare and bind scripts
	- [Edit Script](/en/docs/script/edit/): Script editing interface, importing third-party packages, previewing, and event debugging
	- [Script Attributes](/en/docs/script/attributes/)
	- [Event Communication](/en/docs/script/communication/)
