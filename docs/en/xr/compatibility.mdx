The XR system supports multiple backends (see [XR Overview](/en/docs/xr/overall)), but **currently only the WebXR standard is officially supported**. Therefore, the compatibility of XR interactions is **limited by device support for WebXR**.  

Before using XR features, refer to [CanIUse](https://caniuse.com/?search=webxr) to evaluate the runtime environment. Below is a summary of current WebXR compatibility:

## Device Support  

### PC  
- Browsers supporting WebXR on PC (this article uses Mac Chrome)  
- PC Chrome can install the [Immersive Web Emulator](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/immersive-web-emulator/cgffilbpcibhmcfbgggfhfolhkfbhmik) or other WebXR simulation plugins  

### Android  
- Devices and browsers supporting WebXR (this article uses Android phones with mobile Chrome apps)  
- Android phones require additional installation of [Google Play Services for AR](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.ar.core&hl=en_US&pli=1)  

### iOS  
- Safari on iPhones does not support WebXR  
- Apple Vision Pro supports WebXR  

### Head-Mounted Displays (HMDs)  
- Varies by device. Refer to the official HMD documentation for compatibility details. Most HMD browsers (Chromium-based) support WebXR.

## Runtime Compatibility Check  

In runtime, you can use the following code to check if the environment supports `AR` or `VR`:  

```typescript  
// Check if AR is supported  
xrManager.sessionManager.isSupportedMode(XRSessionMode.AR);  
```  

Before adding features, you can check compatibility using:  

```typescript  
// Check if image tracking is supported  
xrManager.isSupportedFeature(XRImageTracking);  
```

## Enabling Experimental Features on Android  

Android supports certain experimental features, but they are disabled by default. You can enable them via flags:  
**Open Chrome on Android** → **Navigate to chrome://flags** → **Search for WebXR** → **Enable WebXR Incubations**
