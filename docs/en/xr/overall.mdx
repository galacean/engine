`XR` is a general term used to describe the concept of **Extended Reality**, which includes **Virtual Reality (VR)**, **Augmented Reality (AR)**, and **Mixed Reality (MR)**.

## Architecture  

Galacean provides a clean and flexible design for XR:  

- **Clean**: When no XR capabilities are required, the package contains no XR logic, and the size remains unchanged.  
- **Flexible**: Pluggable features simplify development.  
- **Future-ready**: A multi-backend design that can be adapted to different platforms and interfaces in the future.

## Module Management  

| Package                             | Description                          | Related Documentation |  
| :---------------------------------- | :----------------------------------- | :-------------------- |  
| `@galacean/engine-xr`               | Core architecture logic              | [API](/apis/galacean) |  
| `@galacean/engine-web-xr`           | Backend package                      | [Doc](/en/docs/physics/overall) |  
| `@galacean/engine-toolkit-xr`       | Advanced tool components             | [Doc](/en/docs/xr/toolkit) |  

> `@galacean/engine-xr` and `@galacean/engine-web-xr` are mandatory dependencies for implementing **WebXR**. In contrast, `@galacean/engine-toolkit-xr` is not required but simplifies XR development in the editor.  

> The dependency rules between XR packages follow the [version dependency rules](/en/docs/basics/version/#版本依赖):  
> - The versions of `@galacean/engine-xr` and `@galacean/engine-web-xr` must match the version of `@galacean/engine`.  
> - The **major version** of `@galacean/engine-toolkit-xr` must match that of `@galacean/engine`.

## Quick Start  

In this section, you will learn to:  

- Quickly [develop XR interactions](/en/docs/xr/quickStart/develop) and [debug XR interactions](/en/docs/xr/quickStart/debug) without prior expertise.  
- For deeper insights into Galacean XR, refer to [XR Core Logic](/en/docs/xr/system/manager).  
- Finally, understanding [XR Compatibility](/en/docs/xr/compatibility) helps you assess project risks holistically.
