`XR` is a general term used to describe the concept of Extended Reality, which includes Virtual Reality (VR), Augmented Reality (AR), and Mixed Reality (MR).

## Architecture

Galacean has designed XR to be clean and flexible:

- Clean: When XR capabilities are not needed, the package does not contain any XR logic, and the size does not increase at all.
- Flexible: Pluggable functionality makes development easier.
- Future-oriented: Multi-backend design allows for adaptation to different platforms and interfaces in the future.

## Module Management

| Package | Description | Related Documentation |
| :-- | :-- | --- |
| [@galacean/engine-xr](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@galacean/engine-xr) | Core architecture logic | [API](/apis/galacean) |
| [@galacean/engine-web-xr](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@galacean/engine-web-xr) | Backend package | [Doc](/en/docs/physics/overall) |
| [@galacean/engine-toolkit-xr](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@galacean/engine-toolkit-xr) | Advanced tool components | [Doc](/en/docs/xr/toolkit) |

> `@galacean/engine-xr` and `@galacean/engine-web-xr` are dependencies that must be introduced to implement **WebXR**. Compared to these two packages, `@galacean/engine-toolkit-xr` is not mandatory, but its presence can make XR development in the editor much simpler.

> The dependency rules between XR packages follow the [version dependency rules](/en/docs/basics/version/#版本依赖), meaning that the versions of `@galacean/engine-xr` and `@galacean/engine-web-xr` must be consistent with `@galacean/engine`, and the major version of `@galacean/engine-toolkit-xr` must be consistent with `@galacean/engine`.

## Quick Start

In this section, you can:

- Quickly [develop XR interactions](/en/docs/xr/quickStart/develop) and [debug XR interactions](/en/docs/xr/quickStart/debug) without any specialized knowledge.
- If you want to deeply understand Galacean XR, refer to [XR Core Logic](/en/docs/xr/system/manager).
- Finally, by understanding [XR Compatibility](/en/docs/xr/compatibility), you can overall control project risks.
