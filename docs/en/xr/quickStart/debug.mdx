This document primarily introduces how to debug on PC and preview/debug on XR devices.  

> All the following debugging steps are based on **WebXR development** unless otherwise specified.  

## PC Debugging  

First, prepare the debugging environment:  
- Use a **Chrome browser supporting WebXR** on PC  
- Install the [Immersive Web Emulator](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/immersive-web-emulator/cgffilbpcibhmcfbgggfhfolhkfbhmik) extension  

> For extension usage instructions, refer to the [Immersive Web Emulator repository](https://github.com/meta-quest/immersive-web-emulator)  

After preparation, you can preview XR projects in the editor:

Alternatively, download the project locally and preview via script build:  

```bash  
npm install  
npm run https  
```

> **HTTPS is required** for WebXR, so ensure HTTPS is enabled during project debugging.  

## Mobile Debugging  

Requirements for mobile debugging:  
- **Device supports ARCore** (refer to [ARCore-supported devices](https://developers.google.com/ar/devices))  
- Installed **WebXR-compatible browser** (e.g., Chrome Mobile App)  
- Installed [Google Play Services for AR](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.ar.core&hl=en_US&pli=1)  

> `Google Play Services for AR` is Google's augmented reality platform (ARCore). Some devices come pre-installed; if not, search in the app store. Below is an example from Xiaomi App Store:

With all conditions met, you can preview locally built projects on your phone (**ensure the phone and PC are on the same local network**):

### Debugging  

Refer to [Remote Debugging Android Devices](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/devtools/remote-debugging?hl=zh-cn). XR device debugging follows the same principle.  

> Before debugging, ensure **Developer Options** are enabled and **USB Debugging** is allowed on the phone.  

## Best Practices  

Since XR debugging can be complex, we recommend completing most work and verification during the PC preview/debugging phase to significantly improve development efficiency.
